A GeoServer deployed in production environment may host several layers that serve data from multiple data sources (datastores). GeoServer offers a monitor extension (https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/monitoring/index.html) that tracks the requests received by the GeoServer and collects information such as requested resources, response time, response status and so on. The monitor extension supports two methods of storing these metrics. The first option is memory storage, where the metrics on the last 100 requests are stored in memory. However, this storage is volatile and information is lost when the GeoServer is restarted. Additionally, this option is insufficient for GeoServers receiving several hundreds of requests every day. The second option is audit logging, which stores the metrics in a file on the server. However, a secondary application will have to process them to analyze or visualize the data. Apart from these, the Hibernate Monitor community module (https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/monitor-hibernate/index.html) was available to store the metrics in a database. However, this community module is not available for the newer versions of the GeoServer and also seems to no longer be maintained.\\n\\nThe GeoServer Monitor PostgreSQL module presented in this talk aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations by offering a solution to persist the metrics in a PostgreSQL database. This module is an extension to the official monitoring extension of the GeoServer. It fetches the metrics generated by the monitoring extension after a request is post-processed and persists them in a PostgreSQL database. The persistent storage of metrics enables the administrators as well as the users of the GeoServer to analyze the performance of their GeoServer layers. The GeoServer Monitor PostgreSQL module offers a simple, low-level approach to write records to the database through the use of native Java libraries and PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. Lesser dependency on external modules makes this extension easy to maintain and update.\\n\\nThe module was developed in 2022 and has been installed in a GeoServer instance managed by the Institute of Transportation Systems, German Aerospace Center (DLR) (https://www.dlr.de/ts/en/desktopdefault.aspx/). This GeoServer instance receives more than 7000 requests every day. The request metrics are being persisted since October 2022 and bug fixes and improvements have been carried out during this test run. The open-source publication of the module is currently in progress and is expected to be completed by March 2024.   This work is being carried out as a part of the DLR-funded cross-domain project called \u201cDigitaler Atlas 2.0\u201d (https://verkehrsforschung.dlr.de/de/projekte/digitaler-atlas-20-domaenenuebergreifende-softwareanwendungen-und-geodateninfrastrukturen).\\n\\nSangeetha Shankar\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/KWHLK8/\\n\\nRoom: Destination Earth (Van46 ring) @ 03.07.2024 15:05:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#StateOfSoftware"}

The Department, through its photogrammetric base map production at a 1/5000 scale since 1955, examines efforts to digitize a 480,000 km\u00b2 dataset. The characteristics of raster data, focusing on deformation, distortion, and quality issues in scanned data at different resolutions, are investigated to assess their suitability for automation. The testing conducted within the project includes the coordination processes using QGIS on the Ankara 1/250,000 sheet, emphasizing the contribution of open-source software to the project. The flexibility and community-driven development of open-source software have facilitated more effective project management and customization of the software. Test results indicate the successful coordination of 1,967 raster sheets and demonstrate the feasibility of more extensive testing through remote working methods.\\nThe proposal also dives into institutional requirements related to 1/5000 sheet demands, such as registry needs, storage requirements, usage through the Metadata GeoPortal (Harita Bilgi Bankas\u0131 \u2013 HBB), and web presentation. The management of open-source GeoTiff files used in the presentation with GeoServer is particularly emphasized, illustrating how storage needs change during the presentation. The use of open-source software is highlighted for its cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and increased access to a broad user base, proposing a model for the widespread adoption of this approach in similar projects.\\nIn conclusion, this work emphasizes improvements in the map management processes of the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre and the successes achieved in the coordination of Standard Topographic Maps, advocating for the adoption of this open-source approach in comparable projects.\\n\\nSalih Yalcin\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/X3DWV7/\\n\\nRoom: Destination Earth (Van46 ring) @ 03.07.2024 15:10:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

When I try to convince my colleagues that the approach mentioned in this presentation is fun, they look at me alienated.\\n\\nThis presentation will highlight the usage of pygeometa, mdme and DevOps workflow in two projects from different domains of interest.\\n\\n# Land-Soil-Crop data\\n\\nISRIC is endorsing the pygeometa MCF format, a YAML-based representation originally developed as a subset of ISO 19115 metadata, advertised by the pygeometa community as &apos;Metadata Creation for the Rest of Us&apos;. YAML reads much better then XML, and is optimal for content versioning in Git. But YAML comes with its peculiarities, such as strict indenting and reserved characters.\\n\\n&apos;Average users should not look at code, instead use shiny (web) interfaces&apos; is a quote often used, but we&apos;re not used to reverse the quote: \"As a DevOps engineer I hate shiny interfaces. I want to look at code, see the history of that code, who changed what, when, and how can I fix it\".\\nThis is where the fun part of pygeometa MCF comes in. CI/CD pipelines which run on content changes validate the YAML format and report errors to the submitters.\\n\\nShould we then fully neglect the basic user? Of course not! So we crafted web based forms that generate mcf (osgeo.github.io/mdme) and have import options for Excel sheets (every column is a metadata field). Consider that many data scientists (fortunately) are used to placing a README.md in any project folder. We just ask them to structure the content using YAML. We added an inheritance mechanism, so common properties (contact details, usage constraints) are inserted only once and inherited by lower levels in the folder hierarchy. And embedded metadata is extracted from data files (bounds, projection, format) or online sources.\\n\\nAll this metadata is crawled to a central search index (pycsw/pygeoapi/geonetwork). To increase the participatory experience we added &apos;Edit me on GIT&apos; links to each of the records, which brings users back to the original mcf file to suggest changes.\\n\\n# Weather/climate/water metadata\\n\\nThe WMO Information System (WIS2) is the next generation data exchange infrastructure for real-time and archive weather/climate/water data.  Discovery metadata is a key component for cataloguing and discovery.  An event driven architecture, metadata files are managed on GitHub, which on change, trigger CI/CD workflow to generate compliant WMO discovery metadata, validation and publish to an MQTT broker.\\n\\nTom Kralidis\\nPaul van Genuchten\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/3LPRP3/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 03.07.2024 11:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

During the presentation, we will share not only the technological solutions we have adopted, but also our experience in changing the attitude of GIS specialists with experience of working with commercial GIS software towards open source.\\n\\nThe main technological components of the project included the development of a data management system using PostGIS and QGIS, the development of a map browser using openlayers and Vue JS (available as an open source project - https://github.com/AplinkosMinisterija/biip-maps-web), and the development of a service publishing solution based on QGIS Server. The project used Docker technology and GitHub action-based continuous deployment (CD) solutions, which should also be relevant to the audience.\\n\\nMany of us know that building a system from the ground up is often much easier than upgrading an existing system that has been in place for a long time but has not been updated. This was the case for the National River and Lakes Cadastre as well. This process is particularly challenging when it comes to the modernisation of national information systems and cadastres, which are often subject to quite strict legislative control. There are also a number of challenges at the technical level: 1) old and outdated software that cannot be upgraded without overhauling the system, 2) integrations with other systems, 3) old infrastructure, 4) code that is closed and unmanageable by the organization, and 5) users who are working with the data, who are challenged by the new solutions. This is exactly the same set of problems that awaited the modernisation of the Lithuanian National Cadastre of Rivers and Lakes, managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\nThe Lithuanian National Cadastre of Rivers and Lakes is a system for collecting, organizing and making available to other information systems and to the public data on rivers, lakes, ponds, as well as hydraulic engineering structures such as hydroelectric power plants, overflow culverts, fish ladders, fish passes, research stations, etc. The cadastre consists of three major components: the administration of GIS data, the publishing and viewing of online map services, and the provision of e-services (extracts, statistics). This cadastre is of particular importance as it is not only essential for the monitoring of the hydrographic network, but also for the protection of these features and the restriction of agricultural activities.\\n\\nThe digital cadastre of rivers and lakes was launched almost 10 years ago, and at that time it was one of the largest GIS projects in Lithuania. The cadastre was implemented using only commercial software: ArcGIS (ArcMap, ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS JS api), Oracle, Alfresco (document management system), etc. Over time, the Environment Agency has been unable to upgrade the software of these systems due to licensing costs, and has lost support as a result. The system soon showed its weaknesses: the system&apos;s availability was unacceptable (the load time of web map was 1 minute at peak times), the incorrectly implemented database structure led to a large number of errors, as the data was administered using a programmed plug-in in the ArcMap environment, any changes were difficult to implement and in practice were difficult to support due to the old code and outdated versions of ArcMap software.\\n\\nWe came into the modernisation project with the basic idea of migrating the core functionality to open source solutions, i.e. migrating exactly what is being used and not bloated with legacy software solutions. In this presentation, we will share these insights from the project:\\n\\n - Use of PostGIS for automated data filling, e.g. automated analysis of river tributaries, lengths, distances to parent river headwaters, etc. All of this is realized with the help of PostGIS functions;\\n\\n - Database structure and use to ensure data integrity;\\n\\n - Creating a map browser using OpenLayers and Vue JS as a reusable component that now serves also for other informational systems;\\n\\n - Use of QGIS server and Docker;\\n\\n - GitHub and continuous deployment to dev, staging and production environments.\\n\\nAndrius Balciunas\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/F7A7PZ/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 03.07.2024 14:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#TransitionToFoss4G"}

This will replace the current river network based on 50,000 scale data.\\n\\nThe existing river network contains around 85,000 Km of water channels, whereas the new dataset is almost 125,000 Km in length. However, the new dataset contains gaps where water flow is not visible, such as through culverts under roads, and lacks essential attributes required for environmental monitoring such as flow direction and stream order. Currently, a project is underway to join gaps in this dataset, create flow lines through waterbodies such as lakes and transitional waters, add missing features, and connect the network through groundwater aquifiers.\\n\\nAn on-line GIS editing portal was developed to support the project using open-source software, which will be the focus of the talk. A front-end web GIS was developed using OSGeo projects OpenLayers and GeoExt, and other open-source geospatial JavaScript libraries including cpsi-mapview.\\nThe backend uses MapServer and Python web services, building on numerous open-source geospatial libraries including NetworkX, Shapely, skgeom, and two libraries created by Compass Informatics: Wayfarer, a Python library for analysing geospatial networks, and Cascade, a Python library for applying stream orders to vector networks. Cascade will be released as an open-source library as part of this project.\\n\\nUpon completion, the new river network will enhance the EPA&apos;s modelling and assessment capabilities across water and environmental domains. This includes sediment and flow modelling, catchment assessments, water quality monitoring, and delineation of river waterbodies. The new network will benefit many other organisations for applications such as fisheries and flood management and become a key component of Ireland&apos;s national data infrastructure.\\n\\nSeth Girvin\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/UCEL89/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 03.07.2024 15:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

How to combine different platforms smoothly and how to get the most out of them is the problem new users are usually dealing with. One way to structure the learning is introducing learning paths to articulate the learning goals and the most useful path to navigate different learning modules and courses.\\n\\nMost e-learning platforms can use some kind of learning paths as a way to structure learning but they are applicable also to contact training and online training. Learning paths are a way to help the learner to build their knowledge in a structured way. They can be either visual representations of how to navigate the courses or built into your platform. The purpose is to guide students from the current level of competence towards a better level of competence. Learning paths need to be structured in a way the learner can track their progress and choose a different path if their learning needs change. Learning paths give the learner more flexibility and a sense of empowerment in their learning process.\\n\\nFrom the course organiser, systematic planning is required in constructing course content to ensure that courses do not remain disjointed entities but are logically interconnected. When designing each course, it is essential to define the learning objectives and the level of expertise the course aims to achieve. It is crucial to consider to whom the course is intended and what level of skills participants are expected to have throughout the planning process. Planned learning objectives should be in the heart of the course and should try to support the student&apos;s interest in the subject. To mark the competences or completion of the course the learner should have some sort of feedback or certification of completing the course. These are an important part of keeping up the learners motivation and engaging them in the learning process.\\n\\nOnce the course organiser has analytically examined the content of their course offerings, they can begin to plan various learning paths. It may be necessary to build new courses or modify existing content in addition to the already existing courses, so that pathways become seamless, and learning can be built upon previously acquired skills. Learning paths should allow learners to join at any stage, avoiding the need to start from the beginning every time. Learners should be able to jump in at any point, continuing their journey based on their skills and learning objectives.\\n\\nLearning paths can be just learning the basics of some FOSS4G software and focus on the essential skills the learner needs to use the software efficiently. In best case the learning paths can move from basics to advanced skills and find out they need some other FOSS4G software to upgrade their workflows and skills. Learning paths could steer the learner from basic QGIS skills to using geodatabases with PostGIS and PostgreSQL or to plugin development and using mobile apps to enhance their own workflow.\\n\\nElisa Hanhirova\\nReetta Lindberg\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/CPU8E3/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 03.07.2024 16:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#Foss4GInEducationAndResearch"}

Yet, no single data source in Finland openly provides information about both the public and private sector services. To overcome this deficiency, Lounaistieto has created an automated data pipeline that combines service points from two distinct sources into one database. Public sector data is sourced from the Finnish Service Catalogue, encompassing location and attribute information related to administration, rescue services, education, transportation, and well-being services. Private sector data is derived from OpenStreetMap, including information about tourism and cultural services. Daily automatic updates to the service point database through OGC web services ensure that the information remain up to date.

Since 2010, a significant amount of public sector data has been published openly, and much of this data is geospatial by nature. Accurate geospatial data with nation-wide coverage is highly valuable for many applications, including matters related to national security and military applications. When such information is provided as open data, it can also be used by other countries, including hostile nations. Furthermore, geospatial data can also be used by criminals and other malicious actors, and therefore there have always been possible threats related to open geospatial data.\\nTraditionally, threats related to open geospatial data have been divided into two categories: threats to privacy and threats to national security. Threats to privacy have typically been handled carefully, as there are numerous datasets that pose obvious threats to privacy, such as accurate census data. Therefore, the public sector has developed mature best practices on how to handle privacy concerns, and there are also international guidelines to assess risks related to open data (Open Data Institute, 2022). For example, census or population registry data should never be published at an individual level, but the data should be aggregated to minimize the privacy risks.\\nAfter the Balkan wars of the 90s, the majority of Europe has been in a state of deep peace. Therefore, the potential national security threats related to open geospatial data have been given relatively little attention. Potential threats from other nation states have been sidelined by other concerns, and often dismissed as irrelevant due to increased European integration. This is true even in Finland, which never downsized her army or dismantled the national preparedness organizations. The Russian invasion of Ukraine caused a rapid and radical change in the global geopolitical environment. In Finland this caused a radical shift in discussion about national security.\\nHere, we report the results of a work, where the security concerns related to open geospatial data in Finland were studied. The main research questions for this work are:\\nWhat kinds of threats related to open geospatial data exist?\\nHow can the threat-related open geospatial data be mitigated and managed?\\nBefore our project, open discussions regarding the need for threat assessment in the new geopolitical environment had already started within the Finnish geospatial ecosystem. This gave a useful basis for scoping our research, as well as provided an environment where the findings could be discussed.\\nIn the study, we focused specifically on matters related to national security. Specifically, our focus was on national geospatial datasets maintained by the National Land Survey of Finland (NLS), including e.g. the Finnish topographic database. Even though our focus was on the data produced by NLS, our findings are applicable more generally, as our approach considered potential threats enabled by open geospatial data in general.\\nAs a main research method for the study, we used semi-structured interviews. We interviewed approximately 20 individuals from 13 Finnish organizations.The majority of the interviewees were from public sector organizations. During the last few interviews, there were not many new insights to be gained. Thus, we concluded that we had reached the saturation point in terms of new information and no further interviews were needed.\\nBased on the interviews, we created a number of threat scenarios. The threat scenarios were used as examples on what sorts of threats might be related to open geospatial data. The scenarios were then discussed and further refined with a number of experts on national security and the Finnish geospatial ecosystem.\\nIn our results, we assigned the threats into categories, and gave recommendations for mitigation strategies related to open geospatial data. The results of the work are closely related to earlier threat assessment work done on a national level. Our results include several insights about how open geospatial data could be used to threaten critical infrastructure, important infrastructure, soft targets, as well as the privacy of individuals. Similarly, our results list potential sources of threats including other nation states, terrorist organizations and lone wolf terrorists, criminals, and foreign companies. Both the targets and the threats are well-known already in national security work and are not unique to the geospatial ecosystem.\\nIn most of the threat scenarios discussed, open geospatial data could help malicious actors to plan and execute activities that can cause harm. Based on our analysis, the threat related to a specific dataset most often did not directly target the publisher of the dataset, nor ...\\n\\nJussi Nikander\\nHenrikki Tenkanen\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/VNEKYZ/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 03.07.2024 10:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

Traditionally, buildings are produced by governmental organisations as part of their cartographic databases, with coverage ranging from local to national and licensing conditions being heterogeneous and not always open. This makes it challenging to derive open building datasets with a continental or global scale. Over the last decade, however, the unparalleled developments in the resolution of satellite imagery, artificial intelligence techniques and citizen engagement in geospatial data collection have enabled the birth of several building datasets available at least at a continental scale under open licenses.\\nIn this work, we analyse four such open building datasets. The first is the building dataset extracted from the well-known OpenStreetMap (OSM, https://www.openstreetmap.org) crowdsourcing project, which creates and maintains a database of the whole world released under the Open Database License (ODbL). OSM buildings are typically derived from the digitalisation of high-resolution satellite imagery, and in some case from the import of other databases with ODbL-compatible licenses. The second dataset is EUBUCCO (https://eubucco.com), a pan-European building database produced by a research team at the Technical University Berlin by merging different input sources: governmental datasets when available and open, and OSM otherwise [1]. EUBUCCO is mostly licensed under the ODbL, with only exceptions for two regions in Italy and Czech Republic. The third dataset is Microsoft Open Building Footprints (MS, https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints), extracted through the application of machine learning technology from high-resolution Bing Maps satellite imagery between 2014 and 2023, available at the global scale and also licensed under the ODbL. The fourth dataset, called Digital Building Stock Model (DBSM), was produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission to support studies on energy-related purposes. It is an ODbL-licensed pan-European dataset produced from the hierarchical conflation of three input datasets: OSM, MS and the European Settlement Map [2].\\nThe objective of this work is to compare the four datasets \u2013 which derive from different approaches following heterogeneous processing steps and governance rules \u2013 in terms of their geometry (i.e. attributes are out of scope) in order to draw conclusions on their similarity and differences. It is known from literature that building completeness in OSM (which plays a key role in three out of the four datasets \u2013 OSM itself, EUBUCCO and DBSM) varies with the degree of urbanisation [3] and that machine learning applied to satellite imagery (used in MS) may have different performance depending on the urban or rural context [4]. In light of this, we analyse the building datasets according to the degree of urbanisation of their location using the administrative boundaries provided by Eurostat, which classifies each European province as urban, semi-urban or rural (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/countries).\\nWe chose five European Union (EU) countries for the analysis: Malta (MT), Greece (EL), Belgium (BE), Denmark (DK) and Sweden (SE). The choice was motivated by the needs to: i) select countries of different size and geographical location, which ensure that their national OSM communities are substantially different; ii) select countries having different portions of urban, semi-urban and rural areas; and iii) select two sets of countries for which the input source for EUBUCCO buildings was a governmental dataset (BE, DK) and OSM (MT, EL, SE) to detect possibly different behaviours.\\nFrom the methodological point of view, for each country and degree of urbanisation we first calculated and compared the total number and total area of buildings in all datasets and we examined their statistics through box plots. This was followed by the calculation, for each couple of datasets and degree of urbanisation, of the building area of intersection and its fraction of the total building area of each of the two datasets. Finally, we intersected all the four datasets and calculated the fraction of the area of each dataset that this intersection represents.\\nResults show that in urban areas, while the datasets are overall similar in terms of total area of buildings, the total number of buildings is typically higher in EUBUCCO for DK and BE, where the information comes from governmental datasets. This suggests that such datasets outperform OSM in modelling the footprints ...\\n\\nMarco Minghini\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/9C8CKJ/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 03.07.2024 11:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

Such effects are altering distribution patterns, such as precipitation, and known dynamics in all natural spheres (Hydrosphere, Biosphere, Lithosphere, and Atmosphere). The monitoring of environmental parameters is becoming of primary importance to better understand the changes that we need to address. Satellite images, laboratory analysis of samples, and high-end real-time monitoring systems offer solutions to this problem. However, often such solutions require proprietary tools to better exploit data and interact with them. The open science paradigm fosters accessibility to data, scientific results, and tools at all levels of society. Hence, in this project, we aimed to apply such an approach to aid in managing a new phenomenon affecting Lake Lugano, primarily caused by the increase in water temperatures and the high load of nutrients from human activities. In fact, over the past years and particularly in 2023, distributed Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) appeared on the lake, raising awareness of this phenomenon that can be dangerous for human and animal health. Since HABs are distributed on the water lake surface, an open source cost-effective solution based on open hardware, software and standards can potentially increase the spatial resolution to collect more dense measurements. The excessive algae growth could be composed by Cyanobacteria which can produce a wide range of toxic metabolities, including microcystins (MCs). These cyanotoxins, whose negative effect can be both acute at high concentrations and at low doses (Chen et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011), are produced by common species in Lake Lugano. Among these, the most problematic is Microcystis, as it can give rise to blooms during the summer period that accumulate along the shores due to wind and currents. In these areas, the risk of exposure to people and animals is higher, especially in bathing areas. Considering the potential risks to human and animal health, in this project an open early warning monitoring system has been designed and built upon previous experiences in water lake monitoring (Strigaro et al., 2022) by leveraging the benefits derived from the application of open science principles.\\nMost monitoring plans use microscopic counts of cyanobacteria as an indicator of toxicity risk. However, these analyses are time-consuming, therefore, in addition to or as an alternative to classical methods, sensors capable of measuring algal pigments are increasingly being used. In particular, phycocyanin (PC), characteristic of cyanobacteria, can be used as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass, thus estimating the potential exceedance of critical levels of microcystins. Based on previous studies, this project aimed to develop a high-frequency sensor-based early warning system for real-time detection of phycocyanin in surface waters for bathing use. In particular, the study aimed to i) develop a pilot system for real-time phycocyanin surveillance, using a high-frequency fluorimeter positioned below the surface near a bathing beach; ii) develop a data management software that automatically notifies the exceeding of predicted phycocyanin risk thresholds; iii) test the system during cyanobacterial blooms, comparing the measured phycocyanin values with microcystin concentrations.\\nThe hardware solution consists of a Raspberry Pi connected to a Trilux fluorimeter by Chelsea Technologies, which allows the measurement of three algal pigments (Chlorophyll-a, Phycocyanin, and Phycoerythrin), along with a module for transmitting data using NB-IoT. On the node, leveraging the concept of edge computing, the istSOS software has been installed. istSOS is an open-source Python implementation of the Sensor Observation Service of the Open Geospatial Consortium, fostering data sharing and interoperability. Raw data are retrieved from the sensor every minute and then stored in the local instance of istSOS. Simultaneously, a simple on-the-fly quality control is activated to flag each value with a quality index. The data are then aggregated every 10 minutes and transmitted every 15 minutes to the data warehouse. On the server side, another instance of istSOS is hosted to provide data for reports, post-processing validation, and the early warning system. Additionally, the open-source software Grafana has been explored to set up alerts based on three different thresholds. Each threshold has been developed including a hypothetical bathing water management plan, and they are expressed as follows:\\n\\n```\\n1. Monitoring - PC threshold of 3.4 Chl-a eq \u00b5g/L, corresponding to a value of 5 \u03bcg/L of MCs (with PC greater than Chl-a).

Environmental data, in particular air quality and meteorological parameters, are widely used for risk assessment, urban planning, and other studies regarding urban and rural environments. Finding open and good quality environmental data is a complex task, even though environmental and meteorological monitoring are considered some of INSPIRE&apos;s high value datasets. For this reason, having robust, open, and standardised services that can offer spatial data is of critical importance.\\n\\nA good example of open, high-quality, environmental and meteorological data is one of the Regional Agencies for Environmental Protection, ARPA Lombardia. This agency maintains the air quality and meteorological monitoring station networks of the region and serves a high volume of sensor observations. The Lombardy region is located in northern Italy and is considered its financial and industrial muscle. Due to its topology, during the colder months of the year, the pollution levels of the region increase, in particular the concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), as portrayed in [1]. For this reason, having a well-established monitoring network is critical. The ARPA Lombardia monitoring network generates huge volumes of data, which is served through its catalogue and a set of services. It is possible to download air quality and meteorological observations, as well as the information of the monitoring stations. These data have been extensively used in research, in particular, in the study of air quality in the region [2][3].\\n\\nARPA Lombardia environmental monitoring data is served through the API (Application Programming Interface) of the Lombardy region, Open Data Lombardia. Although this service is highly functional, thoroughly documented and works correctly, we identified some limitations that could pose problems for researchers, especially in the field of geospatial information. This service has geospatial capabilities, such as the possibility to download data in GEOJSON format, however, it is not compliant with other open standards such as WFS, WMS, or OGC APIs, posing a problem of interoperability with other geoportals and catalogues that do follow these standards. Additionally, column names of the meteorological and air quality observations and meteorological stations datasets are not homogenised, making them not fully interoperable. Finally, the ARPA Lombardia services and data fields are only available in Italian, which also poses interoperability concerns.\\n\\nHighlighting the societal, environmental, and economic importance of this kind of information, in this work we present and document the implementation of a web API compliant with OGC API specifications for exposing the air quality and meteorological information from ARPA Lombardia. The data provided by ARPA Lombardia is shared under the licence CC0 1.0 Universal, meaning it is public domain.\\n\\nThe developed API serves environmental monitoring data (both air quality and meteorological) in compliance with a set of OGC APIs. This API is capable of exposing data in different standardised formats, filtering by multiple fields and locations, and performing server-side processing of the observations. OGC APIs are modern standards for geospatial information. Although they are still in the adoption phase, many reference implementations are being developed, and governmental institutions are starting to adopt such standards [4][5]. They differ from widespread, older OGC standards such as WMS or WFS as they are based in JSON and OpenAPI, while older standards are based in XML.

This study explores the transition from traditional geospatial service standards to modern Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) API standards in web applications by implementing it in the field of urban development management. The main goal of this study is to explore the potential for enhancing web applications through a comparative analysis of the integration of modern and traditional geospatial technologies based on their performance and practical implications.\\nThe research scope encompasses the design and development of a modern web application architecture, involving database design and preparation, and automatic integration of data from various format; implementation of geospatial services using both traditional standards and modern OGC API standards, including the creation of a frontend website using Openlayers for the user. However, the core focus was given on the comparative analysis of the traditional and modern geospatial services standards, evaluating data compatibility, deployment processes, and performance metrics with different levels of concurrent requests.\\nThe study is structured into two primary segments: an extensive theoretical evaluation of the standards, and followed by a hands-on testing phase. involving the setup of both traditional and modern services separately while keeping the other components (database and frontend) same in the architecture. In the database tier, PostGIS was employed, Geoserver and Pygeoapi were used in the server section for publishing data in both traditional (WxS) and modern (OGC API) standards to the user tier. OpenLayers was used for the frontend to visualize the data for users.\\nDatabase design and preparation were accomplished using Geodjango and PostgreSQL, and automatic data integration was conducted using Python. The ALKIS (Authoritative Real Estate Cadastre Information System of Germany) includes both spatial and non-spatial information encoded in NAS (i.e., the standards-based exchange interface defined by the Surveying Authorities of Germany)   format using Extensible Markup Language (XML), served as the primary data source in this study with essential details such as street names, house numbers, and land parcel id. The comparison (Geoserver and Pygeoapi) platforms considered key findings, lessons learned, data format compatibility, and the evaluation of the installation process through literature review.  Performance metrics were measured through hands-on testing in terms of rendering time, overall performance of the website for different zoom level for different scale of vector features. Testing also included different data source formats such as PostGIS, GeoPackage (gpkg), and Shapefile (shp), with a focus on how performance varied with the change of the data source in the front end. Apache Jmeter and Google Chrome developer tools like network and lighthouse were used to get the rendering data from the front end. Usability evaluations are currently underway to gain user perspectives on aspects like data retrieval speed, map rendering speed, and the ease of use (e.g., panning, zooming, popups) in comparison to the previous system.\\nIn a theoretical comparison Geoserver, a well-established and widely adopted open-source platform with an organized Graphical User Interface (GUI), boasts robust security features with support for various authentication methods and precise access control. With a rich history and a large user community, Geoserver provides extensive documentation and support resources. It supports a diverse array of data stores, including popular databases and file-based formats. On the other hand, Pygeoapi, a newer but increasingly popular project, emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Offering modern technologies like the OpenAPI standard for a RESTful API, Pygeoapi supports various data stores, including PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Elasticsearch. Installation is straightforward, leveraging Python and its dependencies. While Geoserver stands out for its comprehensive feature set, including support for OGC standards and numerous plugins, Pygeoapi focuses on being lightweight and customizable according to OGC API standards.\\nBased on the extensive hands-on testing, the analysis reveals persistent trends in rendering times across different scenarios. Pygeoapi consistently demonstrates higher rendering times compared to both Geoserver (WFS) and Geoserver (WMS). The fluctuation in rendering times remains relatively uniform as the zoom level increases from 14 to 18. However, as the number of features escalates from 4891 to 23319, both Pygeoapi (1.55s to 7.56s) and Geoserver WFS (454ms to 2.19s) ...\\n\\nSudipta Chowdhury\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/S8THFH/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 03.07.2024 12:05:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

The main issues identified by the SDWWG can be summarised as:\\n\\n - Spatial resources are not identified with URIs.\\n\\n - Modern API frameworks, e.g. OpenAPI, are not being used.\\n\\n - Spatial data are still shared in silos, without links to other resources.\\n\\n - Content indexing by search engines is not facilitated.\\n\\n - Catalogue services only provide access to metadata, not the data.\\n\\n - Data difficult to understand by non-domain-experts.\\n\\n\\nTo address these issues the SDWWG proposed a five point strategy inspired on the\\nFive Star Scheme [@BernersLee2006]:\\n\\n - *Linkable*: use stable and discoverable global identifiers.\\n\\n - *Parseable*: use standardised data meta-models such as CSV, XML, RDF, or JSON.\\n\\n - *Understandable*: use well-known, well-documented, vocabularies/schemas.\\n\\n - *Linked*: link to other resources whenever possible.\\n\\n - *Usable*: label data resources with a licence.\\n\\n\\nThe work of the SDWWG triggered a transformational shift at the OGC towards\\nspecifications based on the OpenAPI. But while convenience of use has been the\\nfocus, semantics has been largely unheeded. A Linked Data agenda has not\\nbeen pursued.\\n\\nHowever, the OpenAPI opens the door to an informal coupling of OGC services with\\nthe Semantic Web, considering the possibility of adopting JSON-LD as\\nsyntax to OGC API responses. The introduction of a semantic layer to digital\\nenvironmental data shared through state-of-the-art OGC APIs is becoming a\\nreality, with great benefits to researchers using or sharing data.\\n\\nThis communication lays down a simple SDI set up to serve semantic environmental\\ndata through a SensorThings API created with the `glrc` software.

O&M puts forth the\\nconcept of `Observation` has an action performed on a `Feature of Interest`\\nwith the goal of measuring a certain `Property` through a specific `Procedure`.\\nSensorThings API mirrors these concepts with `Observation`, `Thing`,\\n`ObservedProperty` and `Sensor`.

While most thematic maps show data with seven or less classes, as determined by (Linfang and Liqiu, 2014), the maker of a thematic map must choose a class count and classify quantitative data to properly convey their message through the map. Data classification methods all have advantages and disadvantages for specific spatial data types, therefore choosing the most optimal method is of great importance to minimize information loss (Osaragi, 2002). Choosing an optimal class count massively helps the map user to quickly comprehend thematic data and discover relevant spatial differences. With a plethora of visual variables, summarized by (Roth, 2017), there are many ways to distinguish classes of features in geovisualization. For styling features, mapping libraries provide tools to make use of only a few visual variables natively. A thematic map requires a specific symbology tailored to the given data, which distinguishes classes by altering one or more of these visual variables for their symbols. While its symbology needs to be legible and visually separated from the background map, it also needs to be created in a way that does not overload the map visually.\\n\\nThe popular open source web mapping framework Leaflet lacks a straightforward approach to create thematic maps with all basic principles that they should adhere to (data classification, automatic symbology and legend generation). In the paper, features and shortcomings of Leaflet in the context of thematic mapping are examined in detail. First, Leaflet lacks any kind of native data classification process that would be needed to create discrete classes of data for thematic maps. Therefore, using GIS software beforehand to classify and style the dataset properly (to get class boundaries and exact colours) is inevitable. Second, for symbology, although it makes use of modern web standards like HTML5 and CSS3 to style vector map features (Agafonkin, 2023), it still lacks styling solutions that are common in traditional thematic cartography (e.g., hatch fill patterns), as discussed in (Gede, 2022). As a thematic map requires some kind of explanation of visualized data, the presence of a descriptive, well-formed legend with exact symbols for all data classes is non-trivial either. Although various tutorials and workarounds are available, those only solve part of the principles. The examples provided by the official website of Leaflet are hard-coded and static, meaning that they will have to be recreated for each specific thematic map, making them unsuitable for implementation in a dynamic data visualization. Moreover, these workarounds are complex to accomplish, especially for those who are not familiar with programming to an extent to be able to code visually pleasing thematic maps on websites.\\n\\nAs a solution, this paper introduces a highly customizable, open source plugin for Leaflet, developed by the author, which extends Leaflet\u2019s GeoJSON class and combines all processes required for creating a thematic map in a single step. By combining all the necessary processes, this easy-to-use extension is a solution that wraps the individual processes of quantitative data classification, symbology and creation of an appealing legend. The extension puts an emphasis on providing numerous options for a highly customizable visualization. It supports well-known data classification methods, custom and Brewer colour ramps as defined by (Brewer et al., 2003), symbol colour-, size- and hatch fill pattern-based distinctions, HTML legend row templating, legend class order, data manipulation options, and many other features. For maps with graduated symbol sizes, it generates widths between user-adjustable min-max sizes. For point features, the symbol shape can also be changed to predefined SVG shape symbols. Data manipulation options include normalization by a secondary attribute field in dataset, rounding generated class boundary values and visually modifying them by applying division or multiplication (to easily change unit of displayed value). In case the input GeoJSON dataset has features without data for the set attribute field (null/nodata), these features are handled to optionally form a separate class with a neutrally styled symbol. Should the map maker wish to ignore these nodata features, they can be ignored, therefore not showing up on the map as a distinguished class. As it is an extension of a native L.geoJSON layer, multiple instances of L.dataClassification layers can also still be used within a single Leaflet map ...\\n\\nD\u00e1niel Balla\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/S9JBNY/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 03.07.2024 12:15:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

Introduction\\n\\nTraditional maps use projections to represent geospatial data in a 2-dimensional plane. This is both very convenient and computationally efficient. However, this also introduces distortions in terms of area and angles, especially for global data sets (de Sousa et al., 2019). Several global grid system approaches like Equi7Grid or UTM aim to reduce the distortions by dividing the surface of the earth into many zones and using an optimized projection for each zone to minimize distortions. However, this introduces analysis discontinuities at the zone boundaries and makes it difficult to combine data sets of varying overlapping extents (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2014).\\n\\nDiscrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) provide a new approach by introducing a hierarchy of global grids that tesselate the Earth\u2019s surface evenly into equal-area grid cells around the globe at different spatial resolutions, and providing a unique indexing system (Sahr et al., 2004). DGGS are now defined in the joint ISO and OGC DGGS Abstract Specification Topic 21 (ISO 19170-1:2021). DGGS serve as spatial reference systems facilitating data cube construction, enabling integration and aggregation of multi-resolution data sources. Various tessellation schemes such as hexagons and triangles cater to different needs - equal area, optimal neighborhoods, congruent parent-child relationships, ease of use, or vector field representation in modeling flows.\\n\\nPurss et al. (2019) have explained the idea to combine DGGS and data cubes and underlined the compatibility of these two concepts. Thus, DGGS are a promising way to harmonize, store, and analyse spatial data on a planetary scale. DGGSs are commonly used with tabular data, where the cell id is a column. Many datasets have other dimensions, such as time, vertical level, ensemble member, etc. For these, it was envisioned to be able to use Xarray (Hoyer and Hamman 2017), one of the core packages in the Pangeo ecosystem, as a container for DGGS data.\\n\\nAt the joint OSGeo and Pangeo code sprint at the ESA BiDS\u201923 conference (6.-9. November, 2023, Vienna), members from both communities came together and envisioned implementing support for DGGS in the popular Xarray Python package, which is at the core of many geospatial big data processing workflows. The result of the codesprint is a prototype Xarray extension, named xdggs (https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xdggs), which we describe in this article.\\n\\n## 2. Design and methodology\\n\\nThere are several open-source libraries that make it possible to work with DGGS. Uber H3 , HEALPIX , rHEALPix , DGGRID , Google S2 , OpenEAGGR  \u2013 many if not most have Python bindings (Kmoch et al. 2022). However, they often come with their very own not easy-to-use APIs, different assumptions, and functionalities. This makes it difficult for users to explore the wider possibilities that DGGS can offer.\\nThe aim of xdggs is to provide a unified, high-level, and user-friendly API that simplifies working with various DGGS types and their respective backend libraries, seamlessly integrating with Xarray and the Pangeo open-source geospatial computing ecosystem. Executable notebooks demonstrating the use of the xdggs package are also developed to showcase its capabilities. The xdggs community contributors set out with a set of guidelines and common DGGS features that xdggs should provide or facilitate, to make DGGS semantics and operations possible to use via the user-friendly Xarray API of working with labelled arrays.\\n\\n## 3. Results\\n\\nThis development represents a significant step forward. With xdggs, DGGS become more accessible and actionable for data users. Like traditional cartographic projections, a user does not need to be a expert on the peculiarities of various grids and libraries to work with DGGS, and can continue working in the well-known Xarray workflow. One of the aims of xdggs is making DGGS data access and conversion user-friendly, while dealing with the coordinates, tesselations, and projections under the hood.\\n\\nDGGS-indexed data can be stored in an appropriate format like Zarr or (Geo)Parquet, with according metadata to understand which DGGS (and potentially under which specific configuration) is needed to address the grid cell indices correctly. An interactive tutorial on Pangeo-Forge as open-access resource is being developed as well to demonstrate to users how to effectively utilizing these storage formats, thereby facilitating knowledge transfer in data storage best practices within the geospatial open-source community.\\n\\nNevertheless, continuous efforts are necessary to broaden the accessibility of DGGS for scientific and operational applications, especially in handling gridded data such as global climate and ocean modeling, satellite imagery, raster data, and maps.

As Earth observation (EO) data products have become increasingly available, a large number of spectral indices have been developed to highlight specific surface features and phenomena observed across diverse application domains, including vegetation, water, urban areas, and snow cover. Examples of such indices include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1974), used to assess vegetation states, and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) (McFeeters, 1996), used to delineate and monitor water bodies. The constantly increasing number of spectral indices, driven by factors such as the enhancement of existing indices, parameters optimization, and the introduction of new satellite missions with novel spectral bands, has necessitated the development of comprehensive catalogs. One such effort is the Awesome Spectral Indices (ASI) suite (Montero et al., 2023), which provides a curated machine-readable catalog of spectral indices for multiple application domains. Additionally, the ASI suite includes not only a Python library for querying and computing these indices but also an interface for the Google Earth Engine JavaScript application programming interface, thereby accommodating a wide range of users and applications.\\n\\nDespite these valuable resources, there is an emerging necessity for a dedicated library tailored to Julia, a programming language renowned for its high-performance computing capabilities (Bezanson et al., 2017). Julia has not only established itself as an effective tool for numerical and computational tasks but also offers the possibility to utilize Python within its environment through interoperability features. This interoperation adds a layer of flexibility, allowing users to access Python&apos;s extensive libraries and frameworks directly from Julia. However, while multiple packages are available in Julia to manipulate high dimensional EO data, most of them provide different interfaces. Furthermore, leveraging Python&apos;s PyCall for interfacing with Zarr files and other high-dimensional data formats is not practical. Specifically, the inefficiency in cross-language data exchange and the overhead from cross-language calls significantly hinder performance, underlining the need for native Julia solutions optimized for such data tasks.\\n\\nRecognizing the need for a streamlined approach to use spectral indices, we introduce SpectralIndices.jl, a Julia package developed to simplify the computation of spectral indices in remote sensing applications. SpectralIndices.jl provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for both beginners and researchers in the field of remote sensing. SpectralIndices.jl offers several features supporting remote sensing tasks:\\n\\n - Easy Access to Spectral Indices: The package provides instant access to a comprehensive range of spectral indices from the ASI catalog, removing the need for manual searches or custom implementations. Users can effortlessly select and compute indices suitable for their specific research needs.\\n\\n - High-Performance Computing: Built on Julia&apos;s strengths in numerical computation, SpectralIndices.jl provides rapid processing even for large datasets (Bouchet-Valat et al., 2023). Consequently, this makes it a time-efficient tool for handling extensive remote sensing data.\\n\\n - Versatile Data Compatibility: SpectralIndices.jl supports a growing list of input data types. Furthermore, the addition of data types to the library does not slow down compilation through the built-in package extensions of Julia that allow conditional compilation of dependencies.\\n\\n - User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the package enables users to compute spectral indices with just a few lines of code. This ease of use lowers the barrier to entry for those new to programming or remote sensing.\\n\\n - Customization and Community Contribution: Users can extend the package&apos;s capabilities by adding new indices or modifying existing ones. This openness aligns with the FAIR principles, ensuring that data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.\\n\\n\\nBy providing a straightforward and efficient means to compute spectral indices, the package helps users to streamline and accelerate software pipelines in Earth system research. Furthermore, it provides a consistent and unified interface to compute indices, improving the reliability and accuracy of research outcomes.

Its 180\u00b0 satellite phasing allows for a 5-day revisit time at the equator, essential for Earth Observation (EO) tasks. Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance (SR) is crucial in detailed Earth surface analysis. However, for enhanced accuracy in SR data, it is imperative to perform adjustments that simulate a nadir viewing perspective (Roy et al., 2016). This correction mitigates the directional effects caused by the anisotropy of SR and the variability in sunlight and satellite viewing angles. Such adjustments are essential for the consistent comparison of images captured at different times and under varying conditions. This is particularly critical for processing and analysing Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs, Mahecha et al., 2020), which are increasingly used due to their organised spatiotemporal structure and the ease of their generation from cloud-stored data (Montero et al., 2023).\\n\\nThe MODIS BRDF/Albedo product presents spectral Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters, enabling the calculation of directional reflectance across any specified sensor viewing and solar angles. Building on this foundation, Roy et al. (2008, 2016) introduced a novel approach leveraging MODIS BRDF parameters, named the c-factor, for the adjustment of Landsat SR data. This adjustment produces Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) by multiplying the observed Landsat SR with the ratio of reflectances predicted by the MODIS BRDF model for both the observed Landsat SR and a standard nadir view under fixed solar zenith conditions. Subsequently, Roy et al. (2017) expanded this method to include adjustments for multiple Sentinel-2 spectral bands (VIS to SWIR).\\n\\nWhile the c-factor method facilitates straightforward computation for individual Sentinel-2 images, there is a notable absence of a unified Python framework to apply this conversion uniformly across multiple images, especially for ESDCs derived from cloud-stored data.\\n\\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce \u201csen2nbar,\u201d a Python package specifically developed to convert Sentinel-2 SR data to NBAR. This tool is versatile, aiming for converting both individual images and ESDCs generated from cloud-stored data, thus streamlining the conversion process for Sentinel-2 data users.\\n\\nThe \"sen2nbar\" package, meticulously designed for simplicity, facilitates the direct conversion of Sentinel-2 Level 2A (L2A) SR data to NBAR through a single function. To streamline this process, the package is segmented into multiple modules, each dedicated to specific tasks within the NBAR computation pipeline. These modules include functions for extracting sun and sensor viewing angles from metadata, calculating geometric and volumetric kernels, computing the BRDF model, and determining the c-factor.\\n\\n\u201csen2nbar\u201d supports NBAR calculations for three distinct data structures:\\n\\n 1. *Complete scenes via SAFE files*: Users can input a local SAFE file from a Sentinel-2 L2A scene. The package processes this file, generating a new folder where each spectral band is adjusted to NBAR at its original resolution. The adjusted images are saved as Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) files, with an option for users to choose standard GeoTIFF formats instead.\\n\\n\\n 2. *Xarray Data Arrays via \u201cstackstac\u201d*: For ESDCs obtained as xarray data array objects from a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) using stackstac and pystac-client, \u201csen2nbar\u201d requires the xarray object, the STAC endpoint, and the Sentinel-2 L2A collection name. This information allows the package to access STAC for metadata retrieval necessary for adjusting the data cube. The spatial coverage and resolution in this scenario might differ from complete scenes, and \"sen2nbar\" adjusts only the specific area and timeframe retrieved for the given resolution.\\n\\n\\n 3. *Xarray Data Arrays via \u201ccubo\u201d*: When users have ESDCs formed as xarray data arrays through cubo, which builds upon stackstac and incorporates the STAC endpoint and the collection name as attributes, \u201csen2nbar\u201d directly adjusts these to NBAR, utilising the methodology described in the stackstac case.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the latter two scenarios, \u201csen2nbar\u201d works without writing files to disk, instead returning an xarray data array object containing the NBAR values. The package is designed to handle available bands without errors for missing bands, acknowledging that users may not require all bands and might have generated ESDCs with selected bands.

Additionally, emphasis is put on the need to prioritize people&apos;s needs in technology development and to promote EU values and rights.\\nThe EU has largely invested in making data accessible. Examples of this are the Copernicus Programme, the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) intergovernmental partnership, and the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe funding programmes. In the scope of such programmes, several Earth Observation (EO) cloud platforms have been developed, providing access to data, tools and services for a wide range of users, including support to policymakers in developing evidence-based and data-driven policies.\\nTypically, these platforms are an expression of very specific research communities with different sizes and scope, even niche in some cases, with various and -often under-represented- user needs, as opposed to more mainstream platforms with a wider user uptake.\\nAs a consequence, the current landscape of EO cloud platforms and infrastructures in the EU is rather fragmented, thus their potential is only partially exploited by users. We started our research by classifying existing infrastructures, identifying available good practices and highlighting the technological enablers, in order to point out and leverage the building blocks needed to improve the usability of such platforms (Di Leo et al., 2023).\\nIn this follow-up study, we seek to provide a user-centric perspective, aiming at identifying limitations in the current offer of EO cloud platforms by conducting a research study on user experience. We aim to propose good practices to improve both the platform design and functionalities by taking into account the user viewpoint. Our research questions are:\\n\u2022\tDoes the current offer cover the entire development lifecycle?\\n\u2022\tWhat are the pain points / bottlenecks to address on the current platforms from a user\u2019s viewpoint?\\nTo create a meaningful sample of EO cloud platforms, we have surveyed use cases from EU flagship initiatives like e-shape, OpenEarthMonitor and GEOSS Platform Plus, to understand more on their use of the platforms. In addition, we have developed an additional use case so to gain hands-on experience on cloud platforms.\\nResponders to the survey were developers of different use cases in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, energy, health, ecosystem, disaster management, water, climate and climate change, forestry and oceans. Intended end user categories ranged from business owners to analysts, developers, data scientists and policy makers, as well as citizens. A common need emerging from the exercise is the possibility to integrate datasets of different nature and from different sources: EO, in situ, Internet of Things (IoT) data, etc. Final products of the considered use cases ranged from static maps to streams of data and web apps. In the development lifecycle, techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, parallel computing, virtualization / containerization and data cubes, are of common use among developers.\\nThe main concerns on EO cloud platforms that emerge from the survey were:\\n(1) The difficulty to discover the services offered / the lack of services to browse the available services;\\n(2) The reduced accessibility to data and services, as well as the timeliness and coverage of data provision and quality;\\n(3) The poor transparency of the price;\\n(4) The limited possibility to integrate heterogeneous datasets and tools from different providers;\\n(5) The limited quality of learning material and documentation, as well as the frequency of their updates;\\n(6) The lack of effectiveness of support services such as helpdesks and forums;\\n(7) The limited possibility of exchanging code, good practices, and support with other users, and the liveness of the communities around the platforms;\\n(8) The lack of possibility to customize tools and services;\\n(9) The lack of strategies for the sustainability of platforms after the funding period;\\n(10) The lack of effective facilities for storage and for advanced functionalities such as machine learning, deep learning, parallel computing, etc.\\nBased on these responses, we identified a set of dimensions of high relevance for users, which are meant for a self-evaluation by platforms so to improve their offer. Such dimensions can be summarized as 1) discoverability, 2) accessibility, 3) price transparency, 4) interoperability, 5) documentation, 6) customer care, 7) community building (data, models and knowledge sharing), 8) customization, 9) sustainability of business plan and 10) characteristics and performance of the platform.\\nAmong others, the adherence to the FAIR principles ...\\n\\nMargherita Di Leo\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/RXWVPW/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 03.07.2024 16:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

With approximately 520,000 public procurement notices published per year that are worth more than \u20ac420 billion, TED is a cornerstone of EU public procurement. The TED database is available as open data, providing an extremely interesting source for in-depth analysis on public procurements in the EU.\\nWe developed an application that \u2013 based on an extraction of the TED database for two  years (2021 and 2022) \u2013 allows users to: i) automatically label TED documents using GPT; ii) visualise the labels generated by GPT for all documents and manually correct them; iii) use the corrected labels to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Machine Learning classifier; and iv) assess the classification accuracy. The application supports an iterative process of re-labelling (using GPT) and re-training the SVM classifier until the expected classification performance is reached and the classifier can be applied to the whole TED dataset. In addition to the progressive improvement of the Machine Learning classifier through the controlled cycle of iterations, the benefits of this approach include user involvement in the correction/enrichment of labels and flexibility in adapting to the specific needs of the datasets and domain \u2013 the latter meaning that applicability is not limited to the TED database. Inclusion of the TED database for 2023 is currently ongoing; similarly, a dedicated UI is currently under development to provide a user-friendly access to the application.\\nThe use case investigates the degree to which EU public procurements are relevant to open source geospatial software, open geospatial standards and open geospatial data. To this purpose, for each of the three categories a specific set of keywords was initially listed; this was then complemented by a series of similar keywords retrieved through a semantic text analysis tool named SeTA (https://seta.jrc.ec.europa.eu, developed in-house at the JRC) and further validated by an expert. The final list of keywords represented the input to filter a list of documents from TED to be annotated in the first step using GPT. The presentation will show the classification results and shed some light on the relevance of open source geospatial software, open geospatial standards and open geospatial data in EU tenders.\\nGPT models used by the application are run in a platform created under a special contract signed by the European Commission with Microsoft Azure. The platform, named GPT@JRC, provides internal APIs that can be accessed upon obtaining an authorization token. Through Python, users can query the APIs using the OpenAI library that offers convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.7+ application. The GPT@JRC offers several Large Language Models including &apos;gpt-35-turbo-0613&apos;, &apos;gpt-35-turbo-16k&apos;, &apos;gpt-35-turbo-0301&apos;.\\nMore concretely, GPT models are used for annotating the TED database by asking whether a certain TED document, typically through its abstract, covers a specific topic. The expected response is a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. By interacting with the APIs, we retrieve the responses and append them as labels to our documents. This allows us to perform unsupervised document classification. Subsequently, we can verify whether the documents have been correctly classified on a sample basis. Following this manual validation phase, as mentioned before, we use the result as input to an SVM classifier (using the Python scikit-learn library) to determine if there is a general rule to distinguish the topic of any TED document from the text of its abstract.\\n\\nMarco Minghini\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/MTEYTZ/\\n\\nRoom: Destination Earth (Van46 ring) @ 04.07.2024 10:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#Foss4GMadeInEurope"}

Leveraging the wealth of openly available geospatial data through platforms like OpenStreetMap (OSM) and routing engines such as OpenRouteService (ORS), this presentation explores the disparities in the distribution of electric columns and petrol stations across different European regions. Moreover, it delves into the potential of utilizing open data to monitor the energy transition&apos;s evolution and its implications for societal perception and awareness.\\n\\nWith the growing richness of OpenStreetMap data about transportation infrastructure, researchers and practitioners have unprecedented access to detailed information about electric vehicle charging stations and traditional petrol stations. This study harnesses this data to conduct a comparative analysis of their spatial distribution across various European regions. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenRouteService, we perform analyses to evaluate the accessibility and coverage of both types of refuelling infrastructure, shedding light on potential gaps and disparities in their distribution.\\n\\nFurthermore, this research underscores open data&apos;s significance in monitoring the energy transition progress in different European regions. The diffusion of the charging station follows different paths in Europe. Initially, charging stations were sparsely distributed, primarily concentrated in urban areas and along major transportation routes. However, a discernible discrepancy can be observed in the evolution of charging station networks across Europe in recent years. While some regions have accelerated their efforts to expand and enhance charging infrastructure, others still need to catch up, resulting in an uneven distribution of charging stations across the continent.\\n\\nImportantly, this study emphasizes the role of visualizations and data-driven insights in enhancing public awareness and understanding of electric vehicles in the European context. By presenting visual graphs and data analyses depicting the current reality of electric column distribution compared to petrol stations across different regions, we aim to dispel misconceptions and increase knowledge about EV infrastructure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the presentation underscores the transformative potential of open data and geospatial analysis in studying the energy transition and promoting sustainable mobility solutions in European regions. By leveraging platforms like OpenStreetMap and routing engines such as OpenRouteService, we can gain valuable insights into the distribution of electric vehicle infrastructure and its implications for the transition towards clean energy.

The first two existing Digital Twins describe weather-induced and geophysical extremes, as well as climate change adaptation. Ine the next years, the number of Digital Twins is going to be grown. Thus, to develop new models, there is a high need to facilitate access to data and ways of working with data.. This is made possible by one of three key DestinE\u2019s elements - Destination Earth Data Lake (DEDL) which provides open discovery, access, and big data processing services.\\n\\nDEDL Discovery and Data Access services is provided by Harmonized Data Access (HDA) tool which provides a single, federated entry point to the services and data. The DestinE Data Lake federates with existing data holdings as well as with complementary data from diverse sources like in-situ, socio-economic, or space data. And very importantly, it provides access to data generated by DestinE Digital Twins   All this allows for exploration, combination and assimilation of data shared by existing services with innovative Digital Twins data. What is more, all this data is provided as a full archive immediately available to the user. The services rely on use of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) standard which means:\\n\u2022\tThe search in the dataset is done according to the STAC protocol;\\n\u2022\tThe Federated Catalog Search Proxy component converts STAC queries into queries adapted to the underlying catalog and returns the results to the user in STAC format;\\n\u2022\tThe services are presented in service catalog.\\n\\nThus, exploring through the datasets and work with data provided by DEDL is user-friendly as well as adapted to the newest trends and requirements.\\n\\nBig Data Processing Services offered by DEDL provides:\\n\u2022\tCloud computing;\\n\u2022\tSTACK application development environment;\\n\u2022\tHook service.\\n\\nCloud computing service uses the ISLET infrastructure as a service (IaaS) deployed on OpenStack - open source cloud computing infrastructure software - with the Horizon interface. It allows users to create and manage virtual machines as well as local users\u2019 storage through graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface (CLI).

In this study an example of such a (pre)commercial service will be presented which publishes Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products (and selected assets) in the form of a WMS (Web Map Service) and WCS (Web Coverage Service). The architecture of the services based on the Kubernetes cluster allows horizontal scaling of a service along with a number of users requests.

It allows data scientists from the JRC to easily access, analyze, view, and reuse scientific data at a petabyte scale. The majority of the hosted data are geospatial data from various domains including Earth observation imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel missions. Data are automatically downloaded from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, processed and stored in an open source distributed filesystem (eos). These individual steps are implemented as microservices using docker compose. To facilitate data access, an application programming interface (API) was implemented following the Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification. It exposes collections of spatial temporal data in a standardized way, which has given rise to an ecosystem of FOSS tools, including pystac and odc-stac. Based on simple queries through REST APIs, collections and their individual data items can be queried based on geographic location and acquisition time. In addition, the JRC has developed a suite of libraries for geospatial data processing (pyjeo) and create data science dashboards (Vois) that were released as FOSS.

The production of official statistics based on MNO data has the potential to provide considerable societal value. In this context, the ESS emphasises the need for standardised reference methods adhering to the principles of statistical production, such as quality, privacy protection, and transparency.\\n\\nIn line with the ESS Innovation Agenda, following an open call for tenders, in December 2022, Eurostat awarded the service contract \u201cDevelopment, implementation and demonstration of a reference processing pipeline for the future production of official statistics based on Multiple Mobile Network Operator data (TSS multi MNO)\u201d*. The project is a significant milestone towards the future reuse of MNO data for the production of official statistics at EU level. The goal of the project is to develop a complete, open end-to-end processing pipeline that should serve as a starting point towards the regular production of future official statistics based on  MNO data Europe-wide. This \u201cprocessing pipeline\u201d encompasses a combination of a fully documented open methodological and quality framework, plus the implementation of a reference open-source software pipeline compliant with the said framework. The processing pipeline will be demonstrated across data from multiple MNOs. If successful, the reference pipeline developed by the project will be proposed for adoption by the ESS  as a methodological standard.\\nThe project is being implemented by a consortium providing extensive experience from both the business and the official statistics domains. The consortium is composed of GOPA Worldwide Consultants GmbH (DE) - lead,  Nommon Solutions and Technologies SL (ES), Positium O\u00dc (EE), Statistics Netherlands (NL) and the Italian  Statistical Institute (IT). Additionally, five European MNOs from four distinct countries will be involved in the pipeline testing.\\nThis collaborative endeavour aligns with the European Data Strategy&apos;s goal of providing comparable and reliable statistics across European countries. The project addresses the challenge of providing open and standardised methodologies for official statistics without hampering the development of future private initiatives nor the continuation of the range of analytic products based on MNO data that have been developed and commercialised by mobile operators or other third-party entities for purposes other than European official statistics.\\nWhile the project is financed by Eurostat (the EU statistical office), its ultimate success will depend on the potential endorsement of the project result by the larger ESS community (integrating all EU statistical offices and other national authorities). It is expected that this will have positive implications for future activities and may serve as a model that can be replicated in other domains, along with seeking closer collaboration with industry or business partners, more in general, in the context of initiating or strengthening co-development undertakings for the production of official statistics.\\nThis contribution will focus on the presentation of the overall pipeline architecture and the description of an initial version of the processing pipeline. The architecture design will adhere to the highest technical requirements and methodological soundness. The proposed pipeline considers the division between data processing at the MNO environments and additional processing steps at the NSI or other parties.\\nThe software will be divided into modules for (1) the processing of disaggregated data exclusively at each  MNO\u2019s secured environment, and (2) the post-processing of aggregated and anonymous data at national statistical offices. The latter is particularly relevant since the post-processing will be performed on aggregated data after the application of statistical procedures, such as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC), that ensure that individual data cannot be referenced back. Comprehensive documentation, including functionality,  implementation details, and usage instructions, will accompany the software.

Outlook for 2024+", "description": "Europe&apos;s journey through the open-source domain is a narrative woven with contradictions, where ambitious policy frameworks and groundbreaking initiatives often clash with the realities of implementation and cultural resistance. This presentation embarks on an exploration of this land of paradoxes, where the drive for innovation in geospatial technologies meets the inertia of traditional practices. Amidst this backdrop, the EU&apos;s legislative endeavours, including Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the nascent Interoperable Europe Act, emerge as double-edged swords\u2014championing progress yet ensnared by bureaucratic complexities.\\n\\nWith a discerning eye, we delve into the tangle of drivers and barriers shaping the adoption and development of open-source geospatial software within Europe. From the lofty aspirations of the European Green Deal to the pragmatic challenges posed by the Cyber Resilience Act, the presentation unpacks how the continent&apos;s policy landscape is moulding the ecosystem for open-source innovations. Yet, Europe&apos;s strength lies in its ability to navigate through its own contradictions. The Copernicus Programme, INSPIRE, and Destination Earth stand as testaments to Europe&apos;s commitment to open data and science, even as the spectre of the war in Ukraine casts long shadows over cybersecurity and data & software sovereignty concerns.\\n\\nThis dialogue extends to the technological frontiers of cloud migration, generative AI in geospatial realms, and the FAIR data principles, each reflecting the continent&apos;s struggle and success in marrying tradition with innovation.

Responding to this shifting landscape, numerous institutions and political structures are redirecting their focus from emergency response to proactive disaster risk reduction and planning. Notably, the public Authority has sponsored the project titled \"Creation of an Integrated Observatory System for Preventing and Managing the Risk of Coastal Erosion due to the Impact of Climate Change through the Utilization of Earth Observation Data\". This initiative employs Earth Observation, combined with in-situ data, advanced algorithms, and models, to develop comprehensive knowledge on hazard exposure and vulnerability.\\nThe applied methodology encompasses three thematic phases: Phase A includes the creation of algorithms and tools for calculating necessary indicators, Phase B involves the design of the web GIS application hosting the observatory, its services, and derived datasets, and Phase C entails evaluating the current state and proposing alternatives for risk management.\\nSpatial databases were continually reassessed throughout the project, hosting digital products created by specialized Python scripts that process optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites, Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions, and in-situ measurements. These data sources contribute to generating timeseries of multiple indicators related to coastline alterations. The extensive monitoring database serves not only to establish correlations between derived indicators and human activity but also to calculate 50- and 100-year simulation indicators for coastal vulnerability under tidal wave pressure. Additionally, a tool for determining passive flood mapping in different sea level rise scenarios is developed using the bathtub approach.\\nAll this information is seamlessly integrated into a web GIS application, named \"Observatory System for Coastal Erosion.\" The application utilizes the Angular web application framework while the Leaflet library enhances interactive mapping, providing a user-friendly interface. Navigation features include zoom in/out tools, selection/identification tools, and an address bar. Users can search data using descriptive or spatial parameters, applying filters, with results displayed in a table for export in .csv or .shp formats.\\nThis application ensures interactivity, interoperability, and information exchange, supporting decision-making and evaluating alternative coastal zone development strategies. Fully aligned with national Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) principles, the observatory has been in use by the Department of Environment and Industry, Energy & Natural Resources of the Region of Central Macedonia since 2021.

Therefore, instant and highly detailed awareness about the health status of trees in mature and old-age stands is vital to maintain ecosystem services, to apply timely salvage cuttings rescuing the timber of dead trees supporting local rural economy and to heal gaps in the damaged forest.\\nWe tested several automated and semi-automated image analysis methods to pin-point dead trees from high-resolution summer orthophotos combined with ALS (Aerial Laser Scanning) derived nDSM. Both are open data provided by Estonian Land Board. Starting with object-based machine learning we reached the situation where simple map algebra was even more efficient in dead trees detection and computational resources. The methodological testing revealed multiple sources of false-positive observations. We had to apply various cleaning algorithms to reduce the proportion of biased objects. The removal occurred to be the major task. Finally, the large-scale test object layer was produced for one quarter of the country (16600km2), and these results were shared with experts for review. When feedback was collected, additional algorithms and parameters were tested to improve the results. Only then the final version was published.\\nThe resulting object-layer is published in open-access GIS platform XGIS provided by Estonian Land Board, which has many stakeholder-oriented thematic maps (CountrysideGIS https://xgis.maaamet.ee/xgis2/page/app/maaeluGIS). The specific thematic map also provides many other open access data.

Several projects are currently underway at Camptocamp, in collaboration with Virtual City Systems and Cesium. We will present two very different use cases: developments around Rennes M\u00e9tropole and the underground network for the SUEZ project.\\n\\nRennes M\u00e9tropole\\n\\nIn a context of digital transition and the increasing availability of urban data, Rennes M\u00e9tropole wishes to better equip its decisions and public policies on the basis of data and cooperation. Ultimately, the goal is to promote cooperation and the contribution of the different actors and \"enlighten\" public decisions and policies, in particular the democratic, ecological and energy transition projects. Issues of transparency, public service efficiency and cost control are also sought.\\n\\nThe platform is developed partly on VC Map which is an Open-Source JavaScript framework and API for building dynamic and interactive maps on the web. It can display 2D data, oblique imagery and massive 3D data including terrain data, vector data, mesh models, and point clouds making it easy for users to explore and interact with the data in an integrated and high-performance map application. VC Map is built upon open, proven, and reliable GIS and web technologies such as OpenLayers and Cesium for the visualization of 2D and 3D geo-data.\\n\\nA particular effort was made on the design in order to offer users, mainly citizens, a pleasant user experience that allows an exploration of the development projects of the metropole in 2D and 3D. We will present the cooperation platform through three use cases of interest for Rennes Metropole : simulation of the photovoltaic production potential, linear transport systems and exposure to electromagnetic waves.\\n\\nSUEZ\\n\\nAs part of its work in the field of water management, SUEZ has a number of requirements for 3D data visualization, particularly for underground data. The project focuses on two main areas: the visualizer and data preparation.\\n\\nThe visualizer is designed to be integrated into an application developed by SUEZ. It is based on Cesium, to which specific functionalities have been added. One of the major challenges was to integrate two types of navigation into the same application:\\n\\n - Constrained navigation. Possibility of positioning oneself in an underground pipe and moving through it without passing through the walls, with video game-style controls\\n\\n - Free navigation. More traditional 3D controls with floor transparency\\n\\n\\nThe other aspect of the project is data preparation. A processing chain was set up to construct the pipe tubes, whose data was initially in 2D. Other objects in IFC format, such as pumping stations, were merged and added to the model, while allowing them to be queried via Cesium. Finally, a textured 3D mesh was used to realistically reproduce the interior of the pipes. The challenge was to ensure consistency between these heterogeneous data sources provided by SUEZ.\\n\\nYves Bolognini\\nBen Kuster\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/GPSZ8X/\\n\\nRoom: QFieldCloud (246) @ 04.07.2024 11:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

Mobility Lab Helsinki is running several agile pilot projects and one of them in the beginning of 2024 dealt with developing the mobility digital twin of Helsinki. We at Gispo conducted a pilot project that aimed to develop QGIS-based workflows for Helsinki to enhance the use of 3D data and 3D data production processes.\\n\\nIn this pilot we integrated 3D tile datasets into QGIS and thoroughly tested out the 3D tile features. One aspect of the project was to identify use cases within the organization of the city of Helsinki and to explore ways for them to benefit more from the 3D data available.   By providing easier access to 3D data and facilitating integration with other spatial datasets, the pilot seeked to enable more comprehensive analysis and decision-making in urban planning.\\n\\nWe learned that with the new support for 3D tiles in QGIS, the accessibility of using such data is improved. With a growing enthusiasm around digital twins, we see that 3D tiles support in QGIS is a welcomed feature, though still in its infancy. We found that at the moment it is possible for organizations to use 3D tiles in QGIS, primarily for visualization purposes but also for rudimentary measuring. However, taking into account the wide spectrum of other features in QGIS, it is only a matter of time until we can see some spectacular applications where 3D tiles meet more traditional spatial data.\\n\\nTimo Aarnio\\nMeri Malmari\\nEmil Ehnstr\u00f6m\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/JGPJGX/\\n\\nRoom: QFieldCloud (246) @ 04.07.2024 11:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

Spatial patterns are often at the heart of many geographical studies, where we search for existing hot spots, correlations, and outliers. They may be exhibited in various forms, depending on the type of data and the underlying processes that generated the data. Here, we will focus on spatial patterns in spatial rasters, but the concept can be extended to other types of spatial data, including vector data and point clouds.\\n\\nPatterns in spatial raster data may have many forms. We may think of spatial patterns for continuous rasters as an interplay between intensity and spatial autocorrelation (e.g., elevation) or between composition and configuration for categorical rasters (e.g., land cover) (Gustafson, 1998). Intensity relates to the range and distribution of values of a given variable, while spatial autocorrelation is a tendency for nearby values of a given variable to be more similar than those that are further apart. On the other hand, composition is the number of cells belonging to each map category, while configuration represents their spatial arrangement.   Another distinction is between the data dimensionality. The most common situation is when we only use one layer of given data (e.g., an elevation map or a land cover product for one year). However, we may also be interested in sets of variables (layers, bands), such as hyperspectral data, time series, or proportions of classes. An additional special case is the RGB representation of the data.\\n\\nAssessing the similarity of spatial patterns is a common task in many fields, including remote sensing, ecology, and geology. This procedure may encapsulate many types of comparisons: comparing the same variable(s) for different areas, comparing different datasets (e.g., different sensors), or comparing the same area but at different times.\\n\\nGiven various possible scientific questions and the fact that we have a plethora of forms of spatial data, there is no universal method for assessing similarity between two spatial patterns. The basic method is a visual inspection; however, it is highly subjective, both from the observer\u2019s and visualization type\u2019s perspectives. Fairly straightforward other approaches are to create a difference map, count changed pixels, or look at the distribution of the values. More advanced methods include the use of machine learning algorithms. However, these methods are often complex, require a lot of data, and are not always interpretable. An alternative and general approach, inpired by content-based image retrieval (Kato, 1992), is to use spatial signatures to represent spatial patterns and dissimilarity measures to compare them (Jasiewicz and Stepinski, 2013).\\n\\nA spatial signature is any numerical representation (compression) of a spatial pattern. For a categorical raster, it can be a co-occurrence vector of classes in a local window, while for a time series, it may be a vector of values in a given cell. Then, having spatial signatures for both areas (sensors, moments), we can compare them using a dissimilarity measure (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.) (Cha, 2007). This approach can compare complex, multidimensional spatial patterns, but at the same time, it gives some degree of interpretability. It can also be further applied to many techniques of spatial data analysis, including spatial clustering (to find groups of areas with similar spatial patterns) and segmentation (to create regions with similar spatial patterns).\\n\\nWhile the concept of applying spatial signature and dissimilarity measures is powerful, there are still many unresolved issues and questions to consider. It includes the topics of scale of comparison, input data resolution, dimensions, or types, used spatial signatures, and selected dissimilarity metrics. There is still a lack of studies that systematically compare different methods of assessing similarity between spatial patterns, or suggest good practices in their use. At the same time, a growing number of FOSS tools allows us to test various methods and apply them to real-life scenarios.\\n\\nThe goal of this work is to provide an overview of existing R packages for comparing spatial patterns. These include \u2018motif\u2019 (for comparing spatial signatures for categorical rasters; Nowosad, 2021), \u2018spquery\u2019 (allowing for comparing spatial signatures for continuous rasters), and \u2018supercells\u2019 (for segmentation of various types of spatial rasters based on their patterns; Nowosad and Stepinski, 2022). It will show how they can be applied in real-life cases and what their limitations are. This work also aims to open a discussion about the methods for assessing similarity between spatial patterns and their FOSS implementations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCha, S-H. (2007).

The course is designed to bridge the gap between relevant technological advancements and best practices and existing educational material. Successful participants will have acquired the necessary skills to work and engage themselves in a community adhering to the latest developments in the geospatial and EO world.\\n\\n*Target group:* The target group are earth science students, researchers, and data scientists who want to dive into the newest standards in EO cloud computing and open science. The course is designed as a MOOC that explains the concepts of cloud native EO and open science by applying them to a typical EO workflow from data discovery, data processing up to sharing the results in an open and FAIR way.\\n\\n*Content:* This MOOC is an open learning experience relying on a mixture of animated lecture content and hands-on coding exercises created together with community renowned experts. The course is structured into three main chapters Concepts, Discovery and Process and Share. The degree of interaction (e.g. hands-on coding exercises) is gradually increasing throughout the course. The theoretical basics are taught in the first chapter Concepts, comprising cloud platforms, data cubes and open science practices. In the second chapter the focus is on discovery of data and processes and the role of metadata in EO. In the final chapter the participants carry out complete processing workflows on cloud infrastructure and apply open science practices to the produced results. Every lesson is concluded with a quiz, ensuring that the content has been understood.\\n\\nThe course contains 13 written lectures that convey the basic knowledge and theoretical concepts, 13 videos which have been created with a professional communication team and in collaboration with a leading expert on the topic and shines a light on a real world example (e.g. The role of GDAL in the geospatial and EO), 16 pieces of animated interactive content which engage the participants to actively interact with the content (e.g. Sentinel 2 Data Volume Calculator) and 11 hands-on coding exercises in the form of curated jupyter notebooks that access European EO cloud platforms (e.g. CDSE) and carry out analysis there using standardized API\u2019s like openEO (e.g. full EO workflow for snow cover mapping).\\n\\n*Infrastructure:* The EOCollege platform hosts the lectures and the animated content (e.g. videos, animations, interactive elements) of the course. The hands-on exercises are directly accessible from EOCollege via a dedicated JupyterHub environment, which accesses European EO cloud platforms, such as the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, using its open science tools like the Open Science Data Catalogue, openEO and STAC. Guaranteeing that the learned concepts are applied to real-world applications. In the final exercise the participants will map the snow cover of an area of interest they choose and make their results openly available according to the FAIR principles on an web viewer (STAC browser). This community mapping project actively lives the idea of open science, collaboration and community building.\\n\\n*Learning achievements:* After finishing the course, the participants will understand the concepts of cloud native EO, be capable of independently using cloud platforms to approach EO related research questions and be confident in how to share research by adhering to the concepts of open science. After the successful completion of the course the participants receive a certificate and diploma supplement and their personal map is persistently available in the web viewer as a proof of work.\\n\\n*Benefits for the open geospatial community:* The MOOC is valuable for the geospatial and EO community and open science as there is currently no learning resource available where the concepts of cloud native computing and open science in EO are taught jointly to bridge the gap towards the recent cloud native advancements. The course is open to everybody, thus serving as teaching material for a wide range of purposes including universities and industry, maximizing the outreach to potential participants. In this sense also the raw material of the course is created following open science practices (e.g. GitHub repository, Zenodo, STAC Browser for results) and can be reused and built upon.\\n\\nThe \"Cubes and Clouds\" MOOC equips participants with essential skills in cloud native EO and open science, enhancing their ability to contribute meaningfully to the open geospatial community.

Including practical activities in higher education programs plays a crucial role in knowledge transfer, especially in geomatics (Tucci et al., 2020). Moreover, engaging groups of students along the entire process of in-situ survey design, data collection, management, processing and results preparation furtherly foster their responsibility as well as the awareness of the technologies adopted, actively understanding their limitations and potentials (Balletti et al., 2023). In recent years, STEM and geomatics have seen a growing number of learning experiences based on open knowledge (Gaspari et al, 2021, https://machine-learning-in-glaciology-workshop.github.io/, Pot\u016f\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2023). In this context, this work is presenting an innovative teaching experience framed in the mountainous environment of the Italian Alps describing the structure of the course and the potential of open geo education in geomatics.\\n\\nSince 2016, the Geodesy and Geomatics Section of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Politecnico di Milano organised a Summer School for Engineering, Geoinformatics and Architecture Bachelor and Master students consistently aimed to bridge the divide between theory and practice. The Summer School is framed within a long-term monitoring activity of the Belvedere Glacier (https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/projects/belvedere/), a temperate debris-covered alpine glacier, located in the Anzasca Valley (Italy), where annual in-situ GNSS and UAV photogrammetry surveys have been performed since 2015 to derive accurate and complete 3D models of the entire glacier, allowing the derivation of its velocity and volume variations over the last decade.\\n\\nIn a week-long program, students are encouraged to collaborate, with the supervision of young tutors passionate about the topic, to develop effective strategies for designing and executing topographic surveys in challenging alpine regions. This program involves them in hands-on learning experiences, also directly engaging students in a wider ongoing research project, getting familiar with the concept of open data and with the adoption of dedicated open-source software.\\n\\nThe summer school program is divided into 6 modules whose goal is to introduce students to key theoretical concepts of fieldwork design, UAV photogrammetry, GNSS positioning, GIS and spatial data analysis, image stereo-processing and 3D data visualization. Along with theory, practical sessions are organised with guided case study-driven exercises that allow students to get familiar also with FOSS4G tools such as QGIS, CloudCompare and PotreeJS. The teaching materials used to guide students through exercises with processing software is made openly accessible online with a dedicated website built on top of an open-source GitHub repository with MkDocs (https://tars4815.github.io/belvedere-summer-school/), setting the groundwork for developing collaborative online teaching and expanding the material for other learning experiences with future versions.\\n\\nAdding value to the experience, students also contribute to a research project regarding the monitoring of the glacier (Ioli et al., 2021; Ioli et al., 2024), providing valuable insights on the recent evolution of the natural site. The georeferenced products derived from the in-situ surveys are indeed published in an existing public repository on Zenodo (Ioli et al., 2023), sharing results with a wider scientific community.\\n\\nFurthermore, in order to optimise the management of the information and data collected during the different editions of the summer school, a relational database has been designed and is currently under implementation with PostgreSQL and PostGIS. Such solutions allow for querying the location of markers deployed on the glacier surface and measured every year by GNSS, making it possible to accurately describe the glacier movements. Additionally, a database allows for effectively storing the results of the annual in-situ surveys carried out during the summer schools, as well as documenting the instruments and the procedure employed to acquire and process the data.\\n\\nIn summary, this study highlights the commitment to open education within the realm of geomatics, with the ongoing transformation of the Belvedere Summer School program into an experience mainly driven by open-source software. Beyond the educational focus on fieldwork design and data analysis, the project extends to a comprehensive approach to transparency, making resources openly accessible through a dedicated website.

It serves as a basis for further research and implementation of open data in urban planning. Its results can be used not only for the benefit of the professional community but can also serve as a basis for decision-making by city authorities in the planning and development of urban space. The open data are therefore integral part of developing smart cities (Ojo, Curry, Zeleti, 2015). This extensive study deals with the issue of the availability of open data in Czech cities and to what extent are they used use in the framework of urban planning and development of urban space. In the context of rapid digitization and technological progress, open data is becoming increasingly important for the effective management and design of urban infrastructure. This study systematically analyses the current state of open data in Czech cities, identifies key aspects of their availability and examines their potential applications in urban planning. The study focuses in more detail on Brno, which is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and provides freely available data on its website data.brno.cz.\\n\\nThe first part of the study focuses on the theoretical framework of open data and its significance for modern urban planning. The basic principles of open data are introduced, including the standards and formats currently in use. The advantages of open data in the context of transparent decision-making, citizen participation and sustainable urban development are also discussed. In the Czech Republic, the possibilities of providing and using open data has been more and more discussed in the last ten years, especially at the level of data from state organizations. Nevertheless, the term open data is not understood in the same way by all organizations, when for example PDF format is considered as open data format. At the same time, we also perceive the problem of the completeness, data quality and consistency of open data, as well as missing metadata for easier understanding of lineage.\\n\\nThe analysis of available data in specific Czech cities follows up in the second part of the study. The analysis performed includes the identification of existing data sources such as geographic data, traffic information, demographic data and other relevant information for urban planning. Each data source is subject to a detailed evaluation, including assessment of quality, topicality and availability. The Czech regional cities try to provide open data using geoportals., The largest geoportals are data.brno.cz, geoportalpraha.cz, mapy.ostrava.cz, but there exist others. However, state-government institutions also provide data. The geoportal.cuzk.cz and subsequently geoportal.gov.cz might be considered as the largest provider of data (including open data). A large amount of basic statistical data is provided by the Czech Statistical Office, including the last census from 2021, published mainly as open data.\\n\\nRegular hackathons are already organized to increase awareness about open data on these portals, to illustrate the range of possible use of data and the power of making data available to a wide professional and general public. One of the most creative examples can be the Minecraft world derived from a 3D model of the city of Brno. Such an unconventional method may better attract general public to think more about their city and how to contribute to its improvement.\\n\\nIn the following part of the study, concrete examples of the use of open data in urban planning are presented. The making available of 3D data of cities became one of the most significant step for the needs of architectural or urban studies. We cannot forget the making accessible of the basic map study (The Fundamental Base of Geographic Data of the Czech Republic) including Digital model of relief, Digital model of surface and orthophoto in the form of open data last year by the State Administration of Land Surveying and Cadastre. Some potential can be hidden in the emerging Digital Technical Map. Different insights onto the location can arise with the optics of the crime rate published by police office. In short, successful projects are described where open data played a key role in optimizing traffic, planning public spaces, and improving the quality of life of residents. Based on these examples, recommendations are proposed for the further development and use of open data in the urban planning environment.\\n\\nIn the final part of the study, the challenges and opportunities associated with the implementation of open data in Czech cities are discussed. Potential strategies for improving the availability of open data are presented, including collaboration between city authorities, the academic sector and civil society. In addition, ethical and security issues related to the handling and sharing of sensitive data in an urban context are stressed.\\n\\nNikola Koktav\u00e1\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/V9KYPC/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 04.07.2024 12:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

The FAO Water Productivity Open Access Portal (WaPOR), developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), provides extensive datasets derived from remotely sensed data (FAO, 2019). These datasets play a crucial role in water productivity monitoring, especially in regions facing water scarcity and intensive agricultural activity.\\nHowever, the manual extraction and importation of WaPOR datasets from the WaPOR platform can be time-consuming and complex. Users typically navigate the platform to locate specific datasets, download the files, and then import them into their preferred Geographic Information System (GIS), such as QGIS. This process often requires users to repeat these steps for multiple datasets, consuming a significant amount of time. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of remotely sensed data, including WaPOR datasets, requires validation against ground-based measurements (Wu et al., 2019). This validation process involves evaluating the correlation between remote sensing data and ground measurements to determine their suitability for further analysis and decision-making. However, this process involves a complex workflow and often requires multiple tools and software programs, further increasing the time and effort needed to process and analyze the data.\\nTo address these challenges comprehensively, we developed WAPlugin, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the entire process of accessing and analyzing FAO WaPOR datasets within the QGIS environment. WAPlugin is a user-friendly plugin that automates the retrieval of WaPOR datasets directly from the WaPOR platform, eliminating the need for users to navigate through the platform manually. The manual extraction and importation of WaPOR datasets into QGIS for analysis can be time-consuming, with users often spending around 30 minutes on each dataset. WAPlugin significantly reduces this time by automating the extraction and importation of WaPOR data directly into the QGIS environment, allowing users to reduce the time required for each dataset by approximately 83%. With an estimated time of just 5 minutes per dataset, WAPlugin saves users valuable time, enabling them to focus more on data analysis and decision-making.\\nMoreover, WAPlugin not only streamlines the data acquisition process but also enhances the validation process by offering integrated functionality. Users can effortlessly upload ground observations and conduct comprehensive statistical analyses within the QGIS environment. This includes the calculation of a wide range of validation metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), bias, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and scatter index. These metrics provide detailed insights into the accuracy and reliability of the WaPOR data by quantifying the level of agreement between remote sensing measurements and ground observations. By facilitating the calculation and visualization of these metrics directly within the QGIS environment, WAPlugin empowers users to make informed decisions regarding the suitability of the data for their specific applications. This built-in workflow not only saves time but also ensures the robustness of analyses, ultimately contributing to more accurate and reliable assessments of water productivity and agricultural activities.\\nBy combining these tasks into a single, intuitive interface, WAPlugin significantly reduces the time and effort required for data acquisition and validation, enabling users to focus more on data analysis and decision-making. WAPlugin provides a complete solution for using FAO WaPOR datasets to analyze water productivity within the QGIS environment. By simplifying data retrieval and integrating validation functions, the plugin improves the accessibility and reliability of remotely sensed information.\\nFurthermore, WAPlugin contributes to enhancing collaboration among researchers and practitioners in the field of water resources and agriculture. The streamlined process for accessing and analyzing WaPOR datasets promotes knowledge sharing and facilitates interdisciplinary research endeavors. This collaborative aspect is crucial for addressing complex challenges such as water management and agricultural sustainability, which require insights from diverse perspectives and expertise.\\nIn addition to its practical utility, WAPlugin also serves as an educational tool, empowering users with the ...\\n\\nHans van der Kwast\\nWAPlugin Team\\nAkshay Dhonthi\\nFabian Humberto Fonseca Aponte\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/QURWVF/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 04.07.2024 12:05:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

Citizens can quickly and easily review proposals and variants, explore models and visualizations, express their opinions, pin comments, and vote on their favourites (Ribeiro and Ribeiro 2016). Emotional maps and similar mapping tools are frequently used in Czechia, especially for mapping citizens\u2019 attitudes towards both physical and social features of the urban environment. Quantitative assessment of mapping results can help urban planners better understand citizens\u2019 perception and improve the targeting of planned measures (Camara, Camboim, and Bravo 2021). Discussion sometimes arises about the validity of such mapping, complementarity or substitution of traditional questionnaire surveys. The objective of the paper is to discuss benefits and weaknesses of such tools and to compare them with questionnaire surveys.\\nThe case study is focused on two middle-sized Czech cities, Ostrava (OV) and Hradec Kralove (HK), and selected rural municipalities in their surroundings. Participants are all seniors (age 65+) due to the project aim of understanding seniors\u2019 spatial mobility, accessibility and perception.\\nThe questionnaire survey was conducted in 2022 by the Research Agency STEM/MARK (n=536, PAPI method 86%, CAWI method 14%). Quota sampling used stratification by age, gender, territory, and urbanization based on census data.\\nAt the same time, two web map applications were launched - the emotional and mobility maps. We used the platform EmotionalMaps.eu which utilizes a Leaflet library (P\u00e1nek et al. 2021).\\nIn the map application, respondents indicate their age group and health limitations, and mark one or more locations: attractive locations, repulsive locations, barriers to movement, attractive paths, repulsive paths, and approximate residence location. Each marked target can be further specified by 16 reasons with a multiple-choice option, visiting frequency, schedule, and weather and social constraints (Horak et al. 2022).\\nIn the mobility map, respondents specify one or more of their favourite locations in the following categories: home, workplace, retail, pharmacy, post office, doctor, supermarket, ATM, worship, services, park, restaurant, visiting family or friends, garden or cottage, or other place. After marking each point, they may specify frequency of attendance and transport mode.\\nThe main advantages for emotional and mobility web mapping are cost effectiveness, flexibility of use, usually large sample size, attractiveness of design, ease of use for people with computer or mobile skill, ability for accurate positioning of the targets, customized map design (zoom, pan, etc.), larger extent, ability to describe more specific conditions, use of illustrative pictures or icons, interactive help, consistency monitoring, integrity constraints, and selection from specified options. Disadvantages include no validation of the respondent profile, bias of respondents towards more technically skilled and wealthier people, privacy concerns, and duplicate responses (Wikstr\u00f8m 2023).\\nThe biggest problems were encountered when drawing lines to specify attractive and repulsive paths. We obtained only 32 records from OV and 29 records from HK and evident errors represent 19% and 40%, respectively.\\nQuota sampling was not applied on the web mapping data, only a basic selection of the relevant age group and residence in HK or OV. The differences of the respondents\u2019 profiles between the three methods of survey show clear bias towards younger and more healthy seniors in the case of web mapping and CAWI.\\nAny surveys\u2019 raw data contains some inaccuracies, errors, or odd responses from people misunderstanding questions, misusing tools, trial responses, intention to damage data or outputs, or having concerns (e.g., losing privacy). Deviations from planned quota shares in the quota-based survey may result in the removal of some respondents and/or the need to conduct an additional survey (in our case, 40-46% in two villages). The data&apos;s temporal consistency is deteriorated by such changes.\\nThe primary aim of the survey was to discover seniors\u2019 mobility targets. We asked for their dwelling location and up to four of their most important targets, listed in descending order by their perceived importance, written as a free text. To specify the locations of residence and targets we asked for addresses or another useful specification. Respondents identified 23 kinds of important targets in HK and 24 in OV with the following main priorities: shopping (37 and 24%, resp.), doctor (19 and 22%), family (10 and 13%), walking (8 and 6%), and friends (5 and 4%).

Car dependency is still widespread worldwide and integrated planning approaches are needed to exploit the potential of active and shared mobility solutions, making them an effective alternative to the use of private vehicles. The analysis and optimization of public transportation (PT) services have so become increasingly important in the planning and management of urban infrastructure. This work aims to develop and implement a QGIS plug-in for analyzing urban PT networks, assessing the accessibility and intermodality dimensions, relying on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data as source of information.\\n\\nGTFS is a standardized format for PT schedules and geographic information. It defines a common format for transit agencies to share their data, making it possible for developers to create applications that provide accurate and up-to-date information about services. This standard was chosen because it is one of the most popular and widely used, especially when the data are used for static type analysis. The information extracted mainly concerns PT stops, routes and nodes preparatory to route construction and connection. All data belonging to the geospatial standard, in order to be usable by GIS software, must be extracted, interpreted and converted to a GIS layer. Specifically, all information regarding stops and routes was extracted to obtain a vector layer for each type of data. Going deeper, one of the most important layers concerns that of the PT routes, as it shows the entire urban network, obtained by converting the data within a graph data structure using NetworkX, a library for the creation, management and manipulation of complex networks, including graphs. This graph was created following a personal interpretation with the aim of facilitating the achievement of our purpose. to facilitate the achievement of our purpose, it was decided to model the edges of the graph in such a way that an edge is only used by one PT route. If two public vehicles use the same edge, there will be two different overlapping edges. It is also important to emphasise that each edge in the graph shows the type of means of transport using it (underground, train, bus, ...), the average travel time of that edge, and the length of the edge itself. The creation of the graph is fundamental to carry out two types of analysis.\\n\\nThe accessibility analysis is conducted to determine which areas are reachable within the specified time frames via all the possible combinations of PT lines. Starting from any point in the city, it provides service areas combining PT and walking within a given time interval defined by the user up to a maximum of 60 minutes. The outputs are both lines, all the edges of the network that can be travelled, and polygons, convex hulls built on them. This analysis, already available only within proprietary software ArcGIS, is extremely useful to provide very detailed information about the potential of each PT stop and its surrounding urban area. The second analysis concerns PT interoperability and introduces some elements of novelty. It is intended to assess intermodality beyond the PT nodes (hubs), exploring which paths in the street network have the higher probability of being taken to change from one line/mode to another. The evaluation is purely physical and only considers network distance. Its results are expected to be integrated with complementary dimensions as proximity to Point of Interests, street comfort and safety for a holistic planning approach. Starting from any PT stop, a circular catchment area is drawn using a user-defined distance and the PT stops within it are selected. Among them, those with at least one PT line in common with the departure stop are discarded, the remainder being selected. This is done assuming that PT is generally faster than walking and so, when the PT alternative is available, walking is less attractive. It is then shown how the starting stop is connected to the other stops via the most direct pedestrian path. Finally, once drawn all the pedestrian paths, the number of times that each street segment is used is also calculated, providing a classification according to their potential use for modal change. The pedestrian graph is obtained through OSMnx, a library for retrieving, processing, and visualizing road network data from OpenStreetMap.\\n\\nThe plugin was tested on two different case studies, Milan and Rio de Janeiro, producing significant results highlighting the created plug-in\u2019s utility and application in the context of GTFS data-driven studies of urban public transportation networks. The outcomes of both analyses were consistent, demonstrating the plugin\u2019s applicability in comprehending the dynamics of ...\\n\\nGianmarco Naro\\nCarlo Andrea Biraghi\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/VZPPLC/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 04.07.2024 12:15:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

By acquiring land areas within two years, providing 4 bands (Blue, Green, Red, Near Infra Red) at 50 cm, the objective is to produce a global Digital Surface Model (DSM) with 1 m relative altimetric error (CE90) at 1 m ground sampling distance (GSD) as target accuracy. The worldwide production of this 3D information will notably make a real contribution to the creation of digital twins (Brunet et al., 2022). Satellite imagery provides global coverage, which unlocks the possibility to update the 3D model of any location on Earth within a rapid time frame. However, due to the smaller number of images or lower resolution than drone or aerial photography, a denoising step is necessary to extract relevant 3D information from satellite images. This step smooths out features while retaining their edges that are sometimes barely recognizable relative to the sensor resolution, such as the edges of small houses or the narrow gaps between them as our results show.\\n\\n#### Geometrically guided and confidence-based point cloud denoising\\n\\nPoint cloud denoising is a topic widely studied in 3D reconstruction: several methods, ranging from classical to deep learning-based have been designed over the past decades. In this article, we propose a new method derived from bilateral filtering (Digne and de Franchis, 2017) integrating new constraints. Our aim is to show how a priori knowledge can be used to guide denoising and, above all, to produce a denoised point cloud that is more consistent with the acquisition conditions or metrics obtained during correlation.\\n\\nThis new method takes into account two important constraints. The first is a geometric constraint. The input to the denoising step is a point cloud from photogrammetry resulting from matched points on the sensor images. Our pipeline CARS derives lines of sight from theses matched points and, the intersection of these lines give the target 3d positions. In our method, when we denoise this point cloud, the points are constrained to stay on their initial line of sight. This has two main advantages: the associated color will remain consistent with the new position and points won&apos;t accumulate in certain spaces and create dataless areas.\\n\\nThe second constraint comes from the correlator PANDORA (https://github.com/cnes/pandora). The article (Sarrazin et al., 2021) describes a confidence metric, named ambiguity integral metric, to assess the quality of the produced disparity map. This measurement determines the level of confidence associated with each of the points. Each point is moved along the line of sight according to its confidence: the less confident the correlator, the more the point is moved while respecting the geometric constraint mentioned earlier.  Appart from these two added major constraints, our method still uses usual denoising parameters, such as initial color and position of each considered point regarding its neighborhood. Normal smoothing is included to compensate correlation inaccuracy.\\n\\n#### Evaluation and applications\\n\\nEarly results are extremely promising. A visual comparison of the mesh obtained before and after our proposed denoising step in a dense urban area will be provided in the final article (Figure 1). This illustration shows that the regularization preserves fine elements and sharp edges and smooths out the flat features (roofs, facades). Even if we cannot yet guarantee that denoising will improve the accuracy of the 3D point cloud (or the DSM compared to the airborne LiDAR), this verification will be the subject of future work which will be described in the full paper, we can already affirm that the proposed denoising filter significantly improves rendering and realism. In fact, this denoising makes it possible to enhance roof sections that are barely visible in the denoised point cloud, thus facilitating the building reconstruction stage for the generation of 3D city models (CityGML). In order to evaluate the quality of the 3D reconstruction on a larger scale, we plan to use Lidar HD\u00ae (https://geoservices.ign.fr/lidarhd). This freely distributed data contains 10 points per m\u00b2 and includes a semantic label for each point, allowing for a class-specific quality assessment according to building, vegetation or ground. We are currently benchmarking state of the art solutions according to metrics that reflect how fine elements are missed in the absence of geometric and confidence constraints.\\n\\n#### Perspectives\\n\\nIn future work, we would like to see the potential of adding the constraints proposed in the paper to ...\\n\\nDavid Youssefi\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/U8NFHL/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 04.07.2024 14:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

Among those, in recent years, heat waves due to global warming contributed to the acceleration of drying process. Particularly, the Mediterranean areas are expected to face extraordinary hot summer and increasingly frequent drought events, which may clearly affect the population. As a partial confirmation of this forecast, in between 2022 and 2023 Southern Europe was affected by lasting drought conditions, which had several outcomes on the ecosystems. As an example, in Po River (the longest Italian water stream) the worst water scarcity of the past two centuries was recorded (Montanari et al., 2023). Experts agreed on the exceptionality of the phenomenon, stating nevertheless the repeatability of such events in near future (Bonaldo et al., 2022). Willing to face them, local authorities expressed the need of tools for monitoring the impacts of drought on rivers, so to be capable of promptly enacting countermeasures.\\nIn this context, the authors partnered with Regione Lombardia for building a procedure oriented at the exploitation of Copernicus Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) sensor fusion for water surface mapping, applied in the case study of Po River (Conversi et al., 2023), based on supervised classification of combined optical and SAR imagery. The current work will present an evolution of the proposed methodology, which includes a considerable effort towards the full automation of the process, a necessary step for making it user friendly for public administration.\\n\\nThe designed procedure, built in Google Earth Engine, is based on the combination of three images, namely the S-1 VV speckle filtered band (Level 1, GRD) and the spectral indices Sentinel Water Mask and NDWI derived from S-2 (Level 1-C, orthorectified). Input imagery is selected to ensure complete coverage of the area of interest, with mosaicking if necessary images coming from different dates, a reliable assumption considering that the drought is usually a slow phenomenon. The interval of time between images is anyway minimized by the code, depending on data quality and availability. Training polygons are drawn by photointerpretation and then fed to a Random Forest-based supervised classifier, jointly to the three aforementioned images. The outcome of the procedure is constituted by a map of water surface detected over the area of interest, complemented with an estimate of the extent in km2. Results are then validated and correlated with hydrometric records coming from the field, which corroborated the overall performance (Conversi et al., 2023).\\n\\nThis paper proposes an advancement in the methodology, aimed at enhancing its usability by non-expert users, so to set the base of the development of a tool that can be exploited by local stakeholders. An efficient automatic extraction of training samples, is achieved by randomly extracting the training set of pixels from a binary mask (water/non-water).\\nThis water/non-water mask is derived by the combination of three sub-masks resulting from the automatic thresholding of the input imagery (VV, SWM, NDWI), obtained with the Bmax Otsu algorithm (Markert et al., 2020). The water/non water mask includes only the pixels which have the same behavior for all input images and along the reference period.\\nThe thresholding procedure is automated using the concept of Otsu histogram-based algorithm for image segmentation. This methodology allows to define an optimal threshold value for distinguishing background and foreground objects. The inter-class variance is evaluated and the value that maximizes it is chosen, thus maximizing the separability among pixel classes as well (Otsu, 1979). A modified version of the algorithm, the Bmax Otsu, was exploited, which was originally developed for water detection through Sentinel-1. Otsu algorithm is indeed particularly effective in case of images characterized by a bimodal histogram of pixel values, while Bmax Otsu is more suitable in presence of multiple classes or complex backgrounds (Markert et al., 2020), which is the case for the application presented in this work.  The Bmax Otsu is based on a checkerboard subdivision of the original image, on user-selected parameters. The maximum normalized Between-Class Variance (BCV) is evaluated in each cell of the checkerboard and sub-areas characterized by bimodality are selected for applying the Otsu algorithm, thus leading to the goal threshold value (Markert et al., 2020).\\nAs mentioned, the outcomes of the Bmax Otsu procedure are exploited for extracting random training samples for the machine learning-based classification algorithm. The best classification performance is obtained with a number of pixels that ...\\n\\nStefano Conversi\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/CP3N7A/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 04.07.2024 14:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n\\n#AcademicTrack"}

This way, OpenDRIVE data can directly be loaded in QGIS, for example, which involves less overhead than having to intermediately convert it to CityGML using r:tr\u00e5n [5] beforehand.\\n\\nBy bringing the domains of automotive engineering and GIS closer together, we hope to stimulate interdisciplinary knowledge transfer and the creation of an interconnected research community. With our open software extension, we empower public authorities and research institutions with easier access to highly-detailed road data, which might otherwise be limited to just industrial players. Vice versa, the (automotive) industry benefits from established tools and data provisioning services of the spatial data domain, with which it does normally not interact.\\n\\nBased on our experience with extending GDAL, other domain-specific data formats such as railML, RoadXML and the NDS Open Lane Model could be made accessible for the greater audience of GIS users as well.\\n\\n[1] ASAM OpenDRIVE: https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/\\n[2] Git branch of OpenDRIVE driver: https://github.com/DLR-TS/gdal/tree/libopendrive\\n[3] GDAL: https://gdal.org\\n[4] OGC Simple Feature Access: https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/\\n[5] r:tr\u00e5n: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7702313\\n\\nMichael Scholz\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/SD7SGV/\\n\\nRoom: Destination Earth (Van46 ring) @ 05.07.2024 15:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#OpenStandardsAndInteroperabilityForGeospatial"}

A few months later, they started writing a book together which, from the first commit onwards, was done in the open. The book source code was publicly available at GitHub, updated regularly, and reproduced on every commit by continuous integration. Due to this approach, it initially attracted several contributors, one of whom became an author. Writing the book using many FOSS tools allowed us to contribute suggestions, leading to dozens of improvements upstream. The first version of Geocomputation with R (abbreviated to \u2018geocompr\u2019) was completed and published in early 2019.\\n\\n\u2018Geocompr&apos;, started as a two-person book project. However, it not only attracted many readers, but also enabled online discussion through online platforms, such as GitHub and social media. In the last few years, the book has had a few hundred thousand readers online, gained a few official and community translations, and has been used in many academic courses and research papers. We also started working on its second edition and its sibling project: Geocomputation with Python.\\n\\nIt became clear that the &apos;geocompr&apos; name was no longer appropriate for the more multilingual nature of the project, and we started using the &apos;geocompx&apos; name. We hope it captures the essence of the project: eXchanging information about geocomputation, cross (X) pollination of ideas from one programming language to another, and the possibility of hosting additional content on geocomputation with (X) other languages.\\n\\nCurrently, the main entry point for this project is the https://geocompx.org website. It contains links to other books and materials and also hosts a blog with posts related to geocomputation, which is also open to guest writers. The &apos;geocompx&apos; project is also a Discord server with discussions about various FOSS4G topics, from tools and methods to applications to solve real-life problems.\\n\\nIn this talk, we will share our experiences of writing an open access book, show the tools we use, and provide suggestions on how to start to contribute or create FOSS4G materials on your own.\\n\\nJakub Nowosad\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/HGHQGD/\\n\\nRoom: Destination Earth (Van46 ring) @ 05.07.2024 16:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#Keynote"}

While driverless taxis are a reality in San Francisco, their global expansion presents significant challenges. Tartu, Estonia, is rising to meet these challenges, aiming to become Europe&apos;s premier testing ground for autonomous vehicles. This ambitious project is not without its hurdles, encompassing a range of legal and technological complexities. Crucially, open-source software and open data are at the forefront of overcoming these challenges.\\n\\nEstonia&apos;s unique position makes Tartu an ideal candidate for establishing an international self-driving vehicle testing center. The country offers the opportunity to test in diverse seasonal conditions, a feature absent in regions like California. Estonia has also shown agility in adapting legislation to safely permit the testing of autonomous vehicles on its streets. Furthermore, the nation boasts a dynamic ecosystem of companies specializing in autonomous technology, including Starship, AuveTech, Clevon, and Milrem Robotics. The University of Tartu&apos;s Autonomous Driving Lab serves as a central hub for self-driving technology research and development.\\n\\nOur vision for Tartu includes several key components:\\n\\n 1. Designated testing zones for autonomous vehicles, encompassing both specialized closed areas and marked public city spaces.\\n\\n 2. A comprehensive high-definition map of Tartu, featuring a detailed spatial point cloud and lane-level road network.\\n\\n 3. A digital twin, or simulation, of Tartu, facilitating pre-arrival testing.\\n\\n 4. Machine-readable traffic lights throughout Tartu, enhancing autonomous system safety beyond traditional light signals.\\n\\n\\nOpen-source tools like QGIS, Shapely, Blender, and the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, alongside open datasets from the Estonian Land Board and the City of Tartu, have been instrumental in achieving the high precision required for our high-definition map and digital twin. These resources have been vital in realizing our vision with decimeter-level accuracy.\\n\\nIn this talk, I will provide an overview of how Tartu leverages open-source software and open data in developing the high-definition map and digital twin, key components in our journey to become a leader in self-driving technology.\\n\\nTambet Matiisen\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/VMUTKB/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 05.07.2024 10:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

Even a single freight railway trip along with all the surrounding railway environment produces huge amount of data like the routing data, train schedules, on-board sensor data, wayside field unit data, etc. Such data are normally temporally and spatially referenced. This data helps in correct routing of trains, maintaining and monitoring the condition of the infrastructure, to expand the existing infrastructure and many more purposes. The use of free and open source geospatial software is greatly helping us with the management and processing of these datasets. With digitalization and rise of Internet of Things (IoT) that is based on a sensor ecosystem, we are looking at data that is generated at very high rate and is crucial for analysis both in short and long terms. The background digital infrastructure that handles such data should be state-of-the-art, fault-tolerant, scalable and easy-to-operate. This talk explains how we use FOSS4G technologies to build our digital infrastructure platform.\\nWe at Institute of Transportation Systems (TS) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) started with this idea in mind and developed an infrastructure platform called Transportation Infrastructure Data Platform (TRIDAP). It is provisionally operational and is being further developed .  DLR-TS conducts research into technologies for the intermodal, connected and automated transport of the future on road and rail. Research into new systems in rail and road transport domain requires digital twins. The digital twin structure helps to draw a holistic picture of the infrastructure of road and rail in connection with the vehicles, people and goods moving within the infrastructure. This is realized using distributed system architectures and artificial-intelligence methods. The TRIDAP platform is developed using various FOSS4G technologies. This platform is capable of making the data available to researchers within the DLR as well as project partners and other stakeholders over a long period of time for analysis and visualization. The platform development is a part of the DLR-funded cross-domain project called \u201cDigitaler Atlas 2.0\u201d.\\nThe datasets handled in TRIDAP vary to a great degree in terms of their size, nature and format (numerical sensor measurements, images from visual sensors, streams of data from a single geo-location and many such other variations). TRIDAP has storage feature of these types of structured datasets in a PostGIS database or the non-structured data in file-folders. A mammoth data model is developed to accommodate different datasets in databases, along with a possibility to track changes. Also, provision is made to store non-structured data in a hierarchy of storage space using a NetApp base. TRIDAP supports the analysis and sharing of georeferenced as well as non-georeferenced datasets. For condition monitoring applications, information on changes in the railway infrastructure and management activities (such as repair and improvement of existing infrastructure) carried out in the past, is also stored in the platform. In order to make these datasets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), the system stores sufficient metadata as well as supports the publication of datasets through the use of open-source software GeoServer and GeoNetwork. Most of the data are georeferenced and are stored in a common space and time reference frame \u2013 World Geodetic System / WGS84 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\\nThe platform contains instances of various big data open-source software, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, to process and analyze the data through the development of stream and batch processing applications. To carry out fusion of measurement and weather datasets, we are currently developing a python-based tool to download data from Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) for a user-defined region and time period directly into the data processing application. Weather data from other internal and external sources are planned to be integrated in the future. In order to provide a high-quality service to the researchers at DLR-TS as well as our project partners, it is inevitable to ensure high availability and optimal performance of the platform. To achieve this, we are integrating all components of TRIDAP into a monitoring framework that uses a monitoring tool called Prometheus and a visualization tool called Grafana. TRIDAP also has a python-based tool in development to validate the data being stored in the system. For this purpose, we define a set of validation rules together with the team of researchers / data owners / data generators. The validation tool deals with dynamic live data received from railway locomotives ...\\n\\nAkhil Jayant Patil\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/KDXRHY/\\n\\nRoom: GEOCAT (301) @ 05.07.2024 11:30:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#UseCasesApplications"}

Busy airports are operated 24/7 every day. Safety and security of the passengers, crew and aircrafts are crucial for airport operators. Almost all activities in airports are also regulated by international and national officials. Nowadays the importance of geospatial data is growing for airport operators to efficiently manage airports inside and outside. In this presentation, we will show how FOSS4G software is used today to manage geospatial airport data and what are near-future challenges.\\n\\nFirst impression of smooth air travelling will start with when a passenger arrives at the airport: how to arrive with public transport or where I can park my car? Before entering the aircraft, passengers like to easily check-in, pass security checks and then use various services, like restaurants, shopping, restrooms and other services. Airport outdoor and indoor maps are key tools for passengers to travel from outside the airport to the gate of the aircraft. We will show how to maintain a PostGIS database with QGIS, how to share necessary information with Geoserver and how maps are delivered to passengers to different devices.\\n\\nAirport operators are mandated to collect, maintain and deliver aeronautical data of the airport.

Over 15 years, our efforts have culminated in the creation of the Uralic Historical Atlas (URHIA, meaning \u201cbrave\u201d in Finnish dialect), a dynamic spatial platform that provides open access to spatial databases focusing on human diversity in Finland and Northern Eurasia. This platform emphasizes the commitment of the University of Turku to making data accessible that contributes to transparent science and effective collaboration for a wider range of insights and perspective\\nURHIA, built on open-source spatial infrastructure GeoNode by GeoSolutions and integrated into UTU&apos;s spatial infrastructure (https://geospatial.utu.fi/resources/utu-geospatial-data-service/), goes beyond being a conventional data repository. It is designed as an interactive spatial platform (https://sites.utu.fi/urhia/) for researchers and lay audiences. Currently hosting the Uralic Language Atlas and the Archaeological Artefact Atlas of Finland, URHIA transforms into a live data showroom, presenting thematic spatial datasets through interactive online maps. In addition to these achievements, the impact of other similar initiatives that use UTU\u2019s spatial infrastructure is noticeable worldwide, especially on those that aim to improve the skill of university students which provide more employment opportunities, build the capacity of university staff, promote open access to digital e-assets and improving student digital skills and competences.\\nThis presentation delves into the development of the framework and sharing of groundbreaking new open data through an online spatial data platform, emphasizing platform development and data-specific challenges. The presentation showcases a) The Uralic Language Atlas (distribution of Uralic language speaker areas), an initiative digitized by the interdisciplinary BEDLAN (https://bedlan.net/) research team, and b) the Archaeological Artefact Atlas of Finland, an initiative from over 10-year effort of collaborative research groups to digitize Finnish archaeological artefacts, made available just in the end of 2023. The participatory design and user-centric principles adopted during the URKO project (2020-2022) laid the foundation for this inclusive approach.   and c) a list of initiatives that use UTU\u2019s spatial infrastructure for digital skills development for Geospatial Employment\\nThe first interactive map URHIA&apos;s Language maps, represents a significant leap in digital linguistics. In a landscape where extensive databases of geographical language distributions are often missing, URHIA stands out as a pioneering initiative. Developed collaboratively at the University of Turku, the Uralic Language Atlas provides a groundbreaking open dataset. The second showroom is a workflow in progress, the Archaeological Artefact Atlas of Finland. Presenting data from the Archaeological Artefact Database of Finland (AADA), this atlas provides comprehensive information on over 49,000 collection entries of Finnish archaeological materials. AADA represents a pioneering effort, being the first database of its kind in Finland and possibly globally. Its creation marks a milestone in the digitization and accessibility of archaeological data, setting the stage for similar initiatives worldwide. The third showroom is the list of initiatives with their process and cases that use UTU\u2019s spatial infrastructure for enhancing digital skills for geospatial employability.\\nURHIA has evolved into a dynamic tool that caters to diverse research needs through collaborative teamwork and a commitment to user-centric design. Highlighting the unique open dataset within URHIA, this presentation underscores the concept of following scientific FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. The Uralic Language Atlas and the Archaeological Artefact Atlas of Finland exemplify the commitment to making data findable and accessible, contributing to the larger vision of transparent science and promoting effective collaboration, leading to a broader and more diverse range of insights and perspectives.\\n\\nMeeli Roose\\nMsilikale Msilanga\\n\\nhttps://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/talk/9L8JGT/\\n\\nRoom: Omicum @ 05.07.2024 11:00:00\\n\\n#foss4ge2024\\n#GeneralTrack\\n#OpenData"}
